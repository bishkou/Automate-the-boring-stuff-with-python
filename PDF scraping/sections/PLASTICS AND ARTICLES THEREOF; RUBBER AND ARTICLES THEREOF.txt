Description: 
Plastic hangers being solely or principally for
use in the in-store conveyance and packaging
of garments and garment accessories.
Indications that they are intended for
conveyance and packaging as their sole or
principle purpose may include such features
as:
* the incorporation of sizing indicators such as
colour coded tags;
* the presence of brand or store labelling
printed, moulded or otherwise permanently
incorporated into the hangers;
* sizing and design particular to a type of
garment not normally hung in the household,
e.g. underwear; or
* flimsy or low-value construction and
intended to be discarded, recycled or for
limited reuse.

Reason: 
These hangers are principally designed for the moving of garments in a
retail environment and acting as a form of packing that allows the goods to
be stored and displayed on racks. They may be imported separately or they
may be imported with garments on the hangers.
They may also have features that allow for the display of information (e.g.
sizing tags) or for limited advertising (e.g. brand markings permanently
marked on the hangers). However, it is considered that these are
secondary to the principle use as articles for the conveying or packing of
goods. They are not of the type that would normally be used as household
hangers.
The list of features given in the description is indicative of the type of
features that may show that the hangers are goods of 3923.
This classification does not apply to hangers that are designed to be used
in the post-retail environment, particularly households, for the hanging of
garments which are classifiable in 3924.90.00.

Description: 
Plastic drinking bottles of the types usually
called “sports bottles” and are designed
specifically for repetitive filling and re-use and
are intended for sale to the ultimate purchaser
as empty bottles. These bottles usually have
either a pop-top opening or plastic straw and
stopper construction and may have either a
separate push top or flip top cover to protect
the drinking top/straw.
The types of bottles covered by this precedent
are not designed for the packaging and
conveyance of commodities to the consumer
and hence have no tamper-proof or tamper-
evident features such as snap rings.

flaps, being a plastic fitting with a hinged flap,
designed to be fitted onto house doors to
enable pets access.

Change_Date: 
Reason: 
While 3923 covers plastic bottles for the conveyance or packing of goods,
these bottles are not designed to be filled with beverages and sold in a filled
condition to the ultimate consumer. They are designed to be filled by the
consumer and to hold beverages for drinking.
While the consumer may
convey the bottle from one place to another before, or while, drinking, the
purpose of these bottles is to hold the beverage in a fashion that facilitates
its consumption while the consumer is in motion.
3924 covers tableware, kitchenware and other household articles of plastic.
The Macquarie Dictionary relevantly defines household as (noun) “the
people of a house collectively; in previous times, a family, including
servants, etc.; a domestic establishment” and (adjective) “of or relating to a
household; domestic”. The types of articles covered by 3924 are those that
are used in the normal course of living (in, or by the members of, the
household) as opposed to goods appropriate to the spheres of industry or
commerce.
3924 covers articles for the preparation, serving or consumption of food and
beverages in domestic situations as well as the types of goods typically
used in or around the home. These goods remain here even when they may
be used in other settings. For example picnic sets, take-away plastic
cutlery, lunch boxes, furniture slip covers etc remain classified although they
may be used outside of the home or in commercial settings. 
These bottles are not tableware, nor are they kitchenware. However they
are classifiable as other household articles to 3924.90.00.

Reason: 
Chapter 39, Note 11(d) that lists the items covered by heading 3925
specifically includes 'Doors, windows and their frames and thresholds for
doors'.
The Macquarie Dictionary defines a door as "a moveable barrier of wood or
other material, commonly turning on hinges or sliding in a groove, for
closing and opening a passage or opening onto a building, room or
cupboard, etc." The goods in question fit within that definition in that they
are a moveable barrier of plastic, turning on a top hinge, for opening and
closing a passage into a building or room.
In addition, doors in subheading 3925.20.00 are not qualified in any way, i.e.
there is no stipulation that the doors must necessarily be for human use, nor
is there any such requirement in the Harmonized System Explanatory Notes
to 3925.
Therefore, the subject goods are classified as builder's wares of plastic, at
heading level and at subheading level as a door vide IR 1 & 6.

excluded by the terms of heading 8473, which qualify parts and accessories
by stating "other than covers, carrying cases and the like".
The goods are classified to heading 3926, which also covers other plastic
covers that protect from dust and dirt - the Harmonized System Explanatory

goods made by sewing or glueing together sheets of plastics".
