Description: 
The purpose of this precedent is to clarify
whether the term "consisting solely of sheets
of wood (other than bamboo)" in subheading
4412.3 excludes surface-covered plywood.
The goods are plywood that is coated or
covered (e.g., with textile fabric, plastics,
paint, paper or metal) but still having the
character of plywood.

Reason: 
Plywood consists of three or more sheets of wood glued and pressed one
on the other and generally disposed so that the grains of successive layers
are at an angle. Each component sheet is known as a "ply". The terms of
subheading 4412.3 are "Other plywood, consisting solely of sheets of wood
(other than bamboo), each ply not exceeding 6 mm thickness".
The phrase "consisting solely of sheets of wood (other than bamboo)"
requires that all of the plies, i.e. the sheets making up the plywood, are
wood (other than bamboo). The phrase does not prevent covering or
coating material (such as paper, paint etc.) from being on the surface of the
finished plywood, provided that the covering or coating does not give the
goods the essential character of articles of other headings.
The Harmonized System Explanatory Notes to heading 4412 specifies that
such surface-covered plywood remains classified in the subheadings under
4412.3.
Subheading 4412.31.00, requires that at least one outer ply of the plywood
is made of a tropical wood. For declarations before 1 January 2017 tropical
wood was specified in Chapter 44 Subheading Note 1. On 1 January 2017
Subheading Note 1 was revoked and Additional Note 1 inserted with the new
definition of tropical wood for the purposes of subheading 4412.31.00.

Plywood - coated or covered (e.g., with textile

Plywood consists of three or more sheets of wood glued and pressed one
on the other and generally disposed so that the grains of successive layers
are at an angle. Each component sheet is known as a "ply". Subheading
4412.3 refers to "Other plywood, consisting solely of sheets of wood (other
than bamboo), each ply not exceeding 6 mm thickness". The phrase
"consisting solely of sheets of wood (other than bamboo)," places a
requirement that all of the plies, that is the sheets making up the plywood,
are wood (other than bamboo). The phrase does not prevent covering or
coating material (paper, paint etc) from being on the surface of the finished
plywood, provided that the covering or coating does not give the goods the
essential character of articles of other headings. The Harmonized System
Explanatory Notes to heading 4412 give clarifying guidance on this. Tariff
item 4412.32.00 requires that at least one outer ply of the plywood is made
of a non-coniferous wood.

is a tropical wood of Chapter 44 Additional Note 1 classification falls to

outer ply is a tropical wood of Chapter 44 Additional Note 1, classification
falls to 4412.31.00. 
For declarations before 1 January 2017, 4412.39.00 covers plywood of
4412.3 that does not have any outer ply made of a tropical wood specified in
Chapter 44 Subheading Note 1 or an outer ply made of any other non-
coniferous wood.
