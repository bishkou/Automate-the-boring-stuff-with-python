Reason: 
The distinction between household articles and other goods used or kept in
a house when looking at headings 6911, 6912, 6913 and 6914 is that
household articles are domestic goods that have utility value and are used
for maintaining and keeping a house other than tableware or kitchenware.
Examples of 'household articles' given in the Harmonized System
Explanatory Notes (HSEN) for headings which include the term 'household
articles' include ash trays, hot water bottles, matchbox holders, dustbins,
buckets, watering cans, food storage containers, curtains, drapes, table
covers and fitted furniture dust-covers (slipovers). The HSEN identify
perfume burners as ornamental or decorative articles of 6913. Oil burners,
which may use perfumed or unscented oils and which may or may not have
provision for heating a perfumed substance, are regarded as being like
goods. Classification is to 6913.

Cathedral glass in sheets and not wired, being
a cast or rolled, non-transparent glass, having
an irregular surface impressed during casting

that has any of the following characteristics:
coloured throughout the mass (body tinted);
opacified by the impressing; flashed; or having
an absorbent, reflecting or non-reflecting
layer. This opinion does not cover glass that is
further worked (for example, glass that is edge
worked or surface worked after manufacture
is not classified in this opinion). This opinion
also does not cover glass made to look like
cathedral glass but which is manufactured by
a process other than casting or rolling.

Description:
 
Ornamental glass bowls with a metal support
stand, provided the bowl provides the
essential character of the whole good. 
Status: 
F
Date: 
9/10/2009 
Change_Date: 
9/10/2009 
Reason: 
These are goods which are a composite article with the glass bowl providing
the essential character and focal point. The metal stand is regarded as
subsidiary, providing the support on which the bowl is displayed.
Consequently, by use of IR 2(b) and 3(b) heading 7013 is considered the
proper heading. A bowl is not a figure in the context of 7013.99.10.
7013.99.10 covers (a) figures of a kind commonly used as ornaments in
the household; and (b) statuary figures. Figures that may fall into this
subheading are "a representation, pictorial or sculptured, of something,
especially of the human form" and are only ornamental. Therefore,
ornamental glass fruit or eggs, which are representations of real fruit or
eggs, would fall there by virture of subparagraph a, and a glass figure of a
ballerina or a horse would there by virtue of subparagraph b. A bowl is not
an representation of another object, it is a bowl. Additionally, a bowl is not
purely ornamental, it also has some utilitarian value. For these reasons the
subject goods are not classified within 7013.99.10 and must fall to
7013.99.90.

Description: 
Aquariums, terrariums, glass gardens,
wardian cases, vivariums or similar containers
made principally of glass and designed to
house small animals, reptiles (lizards,
snakes, turtles etc) fish and/or plants in
conditions that keep them alive. 
Status:

Change_Date: 
8/12/2009 
Reason: 
Heading 7013 covers glassware of a kind used for table, kitchen, toilet,
office, indoor decoration or similar articles. Aquariums, terrariums, glass
gardens, wardian cases, vivariums or similar containers are commonly
used for in offices, homes, and other buildings to display living plants and
animals. In addition to the interest provided by the inhabitants of the
containers, their display in glass containers provides a decorative element.
They are therefore goods "of a kind used" for indoor decoration.
The Harmonized System Explanatory Notes provide guidance by listing
aquaria as articles of a kind used for indoor decoration. Terrariums, glass
gardens, wardian cases, vivariums and other similar containers are like
goods to aquaria in that they are designed to house living plants and
animals and their decorative function lies in their ability to do so.
As 7013 covers goods 'of a kind used for indoor decoration' these goods of
this kind remain in this heading even if imported to be used outdoors or for
other purposes.

Perfume bottles are considered articles of 7013 glassware of a kind used for
toilet. These bottles must be made of lead crystal, imported empty and

Such bottles normally possess ornamental design features, the capability of
being permanently re-usable and are intended to have a spray head and
spray mechanism (also referred to as a mount) attached after import.
