Reason: 
Pearls which have been graded according to size, quality or shade and
temporarily strung simply for convenience of transport, with a knot tied very
tightly against the end pearl at each end of the string, no knots between the
pearls and no clasp or other fitting attached, will be classified within heading
7101. As the pearls have been worked to enable stringing, classification is
to 7101.22.00. Pearls which are permanently strung are classified to their
appropriate heading, usually 7116.10.00.

Change_Date: 
9/10/2009 
Reason: 
Goods classifiable in 7117, being included in the Chapter 71 Note 11
definition of imitation jewellery, remain in that heading regardless of their
value, quality or design. While 9505 is a prima facie possible heading, the
Harmonized System Explanatory Notes (HSEN) clarify that 9505 is not
intended to cover normal articles with a festive design, decoration, emblem
or motif. Echoing this intent, there is also no automatic exclusion of goods
of Chapter 95 from Chapter 71 as there is from many other chapters.
looking at the two possible headings, imitation jewellery is defined by
Chapter Note in Chapter 71. 7117, "Imitation Jewellery, provides is a more
specific description than 9505 "Festive, carnival or other entertainment
articles, including conjuring tricks and novelty jokes". Therefore under IR
3(a) the goods are classifiable to 7117.

Reason: 
These goods are manufactured to a style and quality which renders them
covered under Chapter 71 Note 9(a) as "small objects of personal
adornment (for example, rings, bracelets, necklaces, brooches, ear-rings,
watch-chains, fobs, pendants, tie-pins, cuff-links, dress-studs, religious or
other medals and insignia);". These goods are therefore covered under
Chapter 71 Note 11 as imitation jewellery for the purposes of heading 7117.

Change_Date:

Reason: 
Gold coin of the USA, regardless of when it was minted or issued, is
considered to be legal tender. It is thus excluded from heading 9705 by
application of Additional Note 1 (a) to Chapter 97. Legal tender is regarded
as coin or other currency of a value and physical specification prescribed
under the laws of the country of issue, for use as a medium of exchange
that cannot, in that country, be legally refused when offered in payment of a
debt.
