precedent, is high test molasses. It is made
from partially inverted, clarified (high test
molasses), or unclarified (integral high test
molasses), sugar cane juice. The juice is
evaporated to approximately 80% dry weight. 
High test molasses, including integral high test molasses, is classified to
subheading 1702.90.10. 
Unlike other types of molasses, high test molasses is not a by-product
resulting from the extraction or refining of sugar. The product is
manufactured from sugar cane juice that has not been subjected to sugar
extraction or refining.
This classification is supported by World Customs Organisation's COCO
170290/1 (1964). 
High test molasses is classified to subheading 1702.90.10 using Interpretive
Rules 1 and 6. 
Molasses created as a by-product of the refining or extraction of sugar from
sugar cane is classified to heading 1703.

This precedent replaces 20501000, which was
created 02/07/2012 and which was keyed by
error to 1901.10.00. The classification was
correct in the "Reason" text space. 
The goods are extruded pellets of flour and/or
starch intended for use in manufacturing
foods such as breakfast cereals, snack foods,
animal feed and the like. 
The flours and starches are normally pre­
conditioned, that is moisture, and possibly
other ingredients or additives, have been
added to the ingredients. The mix is then put
through an extruder which heats the product,
performing a degree of ‘cooking’, and
producing the dough. The food is cut into
pellets (may also be cut into shapes e.g.
rings, stars, discs etc.). 
After importation the pellets will be expanded
by a method, e.g. frying or hot air expansion,
appropriate for making the final food product. 
Additives and additional ingredients are
permissible in products covered by this
precedent provided they retain the character
of extruded pellets of flour and/or starch.
However, this precedent does not cover
products with 40% or more by weight of cocoa
calculated on a totally defatted basis or with
more than 20% by weight of sausage, meat,

This precedent is derived from certain findings in the U.S. Court of

which examined the correct identification of a tomato product designed and
used solely as a base for the manufacture of particular pasta sauces by the
importer.
The Depatment of Immigration and Border Protection agrees with the U.S.
court that optional ingredients can be added to the tomatoes without
excluding them from heading 2002. The optional ingredients must serve to
highlight, complement but not overwhelm the essential character of the
tomatoes. When too much of an optional ingredient or combination of
ingredients are added to tomatoes, such that the flavour, aroma, texture and
consistency of the tomato component are materially altered, that product
can no longer be deemed to be just tomatoes.
The court found that the addition of a small number of basil leaves did not
materially alter the nature of the tomatoes, finding that any basil flavour was
incidental to the tomato flavour and that the basil was "not enough to elevate
the tomato product to the level of a recognizable sauce."
Tomatoes, whole or in pieces, or pureed or similar forms, which are
prepared or preserved in accordance with the terms of the heading, remain
in 2002 whether or not containing additional ingredients, provided that they
do not materially alter the texture, consistency, aroma and flavour of the

Reason: 
Canned baby sweet corn of variety Zea mays var. saccharata is classified

Note 2. 
Canned baby corn, of varieties other than Zea mays var. saccharata, is
classified under subheading 2008.99.00. See precedent 19703400. 
"Baby corn" is not a variety of maize but very young cobs picked before
pollination. Cobs may be sourced from a range of maize varieties. The
maize variety will determine classification. Varieties of maize include for
example; sweet corn (Zea mays var. saccharata); dent or field corn (Zea
mays var. indentata); flint corn (Zea mays var. indurate); and popcorn (Zea
mays var. everta). 
Note that the majority of commercial baby corn is not sweet corn (Zea mays
var. saccharata).
Only sweet corn, specifically Zea mays var. saccharata, is included in the
definition of vegetables in Note 2 to Chapter 7. Therefore, under Chapter 20
Note 3 only sweet corn can be considered to be covered by the word
"vegetable" in Headings 2001, 2004 and 2005. 
The other varieties of maize are classified in Heading 1005 as cereals.
Cereal grains suitable for use as vegetables remain classified in this
chapter, as per the guidance of the General HSENs to Chapter 10. 
Fresh or chilled baby sweet corn is classified under subheading 0708.99.00. 
Frozen baby sweet corn is classified under subheading 0710.40.00. 
Canned baby sweet corn is classified under subheading 2005.80.00 as other
vegetables prepared or preserved otherwise than by vinegar or acetic acid,
not frozen; sweet corn (Zea mays var. saccharata). 
Canned baby corn, of varieties other than Zea mays var. saccharata, is

pulp is usually imported in sugar syrup but
classification remains the same if it is

Date:

Change_Date: 
Reason: 
This is a preparation that involves fermenting coconut water, the clear liquid
found within the seeds of young coconuts, and allowing it to solidify to a jelly
like texture before cutting into cubes or strips. It is normally sweetened and
usually has added natural or artificial flavours and colourings.
Although it has a jelly-like consistency, it is not a jelly produced by cooking
such as the jellies of 2007.
This type of 'coconut jelly' is used for adding to flavoured tea to make
'bubble tea', as an ingredient in both savoury and sweet dishes and as a
snack or dessert on its own.
The preparation and additives remove the goods from the scope of Chapter
8.
The good is prepared, sweetened and fermented coconut water and hence it
falls to 2008. Additives such as those normally added to coconut jelly, e.g.
flavours, colours, stabilisers and preservatives, do not change the essential
character of the good from being sweetened prepared and preserved
coconut water.
If the product has significant additional ingredients and doubt exists as to
whether these change the character of the good to something other than
that described here, it is recommended that tariff advice be sought.
The water is part of the seed of the coconut rather than the surrounding fruit.

The good is a preparation of coconut pulp being the meat or flesh of the
coconut seed.
The coconut pulp is cooked by boiling it. The product is ready to eat when
imported and is used as a topping on deserts and in drinks.
Although it has a jelly-like consistency, it is not a fruit jelly as per the jellies
of heading 2007, which are made from fruit juices. Neither is it a jam.
These products are set by the action of natural or added pectin. 
Additives such as flavours, colours and preservatives normally added to the
coconut jelly do not change the essential character of the good from being
sweetened prepared and preserved coconut meat. If more substantial
additions occur that may change the character of the product, then
application for a tariff advice is recommended.

Note 2. See precedent 19703100. 
In order to correctly classify baby corn
products the maize variety must be identified. 
Note that the majority of commercial baby corn is not sweet corn (Zea mays
var. saccharata).
"Baby corn" is not a variety of maize but very young cobs picked before
pollination. Cobs may be sourced from a range of maize varieties. The
maize variety will determine classification. Varieties of maize include for
example; sweet corn (Zea mays var. saccharata); dent or field corn (Zea
mays var. indentata); flint corn (Zea mays var. indurate); and popcorn (Zea
mays var. everta). 
Only sweet corn, specifically Zea mays var. saccharata, is included in the
definition of vegetables in Note 2 to Chapter 7. Therefore, under Chapter 20
Note 3 only sweet corn can be considered to be covered by the word
"vegetable" in Headings 2001, 2004 and 2005. 
The other varieties of maize are classified in Heading 1005 as cereals.
Cereal grains suitable for use as vegetables remain classified in this
chapter, as per the guidance of the General HSENs to Chapter 10. Baby
corn that is not sweet corn is classified under subheading 1005.90.00 if
fresh or not otherwise worked or processed.
Canned baby corn, of varieties other than Zea mays var. saccharata, is
classified under subheading 2008.99.00 as other edible parts of plants
otherwise prepared or preserved. 
Frozen baby corn, of varieties other than Zea mays var. saccharata, is also
classified under subheading 2008.99.00 as other edible parts of plants
otherwise prepared or preserved.

Reason: 
Heading 2008 covers canned or bottled fruit puree which has not been
cooked. Heading 2007 covers cooked fruit puree.
The Macquarie defines 'pasteurise' as "to swiftly heat (milk, etc.) to a high
temperature and then swiftly cool to a low temperature, in order to destroy
certain micro-organisms and prevent or arrest fermentation". 
Pasteurisation is a method for partially sterilising food. Unlike cooking, it
does not aim to alter the substance of the food in order to prepare it for
eating. Hence pasteurisation in the absence of other cooking does not
require a fruit puree to be classified to 2007.
Classification is to heading 2008, and, if made of a single fruit other than
those named in subheadings 2008.20.00 to 2008.93.00, is classified to
2008.99.00.

Reason: 
Reconstituted fruit juice where water is added
to fruit juice concentrates in either a similar or
lesser proportion than would be found in the
original juices. 
Such products are classifiable in heading 2009 whether or not they also
contain sugar, other sweetening agents, preservatives, standardising agents
(e.g. citric acid or tartaric acid) products added to restore constituents
destroyed or damaged during the manufacturing process (e.g., vitamins,
colouring matter), or flavour fixatives (e.g., sorbitol) provided the good still
retains the character of juice.
Where the juice content is of only one type of fruit, it will be classified to the
relevant subheading of 2009 e.g. reconstituted orange juice with a Brix value
exceeding 20 will be classified in 2009.19.00.
Where the water content significantly exceeds the proportion of water that
would normally be found in such juices, and hence the product does not
have the character of fruit juice, classification is under heading 2202. An
example of this would be 'natural lemonade' which consists primarily of
water (usually carbonated) and sugar to which either lemon juice, or lemon
juice concentrate, is added to flavour the water. This is a beverage of 2202
as the high proportion of water does not allow it to be identified as
sweetened lemon juice or sweetened and reconstituted lemon juice.

Heading: 2208.90.90 
Status: 
F 
Instrument: 
Description: 
This precedent covers soju, shochu and
awamori. Soju is a traditional Korean alcoholic
beverage. Shochu is a similar beverage from
Japan. Awamori is a distilled rice beverage
from Japan. 
These beverages are sometimes referred to
as 'rice wine', but are distilled beverages. 
Soju 
Soju was traditionally produced from rice, but
rice shortages in the past have broadened the
definition of soju to allow the use of other
base starches, e.g. grain or vegetables, and
other ingredients. 
Soju is produced from the distillation of a
fermented mash developed from the basic
constituents of a starch source, yeast and
water. Other ingredients may be added during
the fermentation process or in post-
fermentation production. Single step
distillation produces the most expensive soju
referred to as 'distilled soju'. 
Soju is more often produced as 'diluted soju',
'standard soju' or 'premium soju' which is
made by mixing water, additives and distilled
alcohol (soju, grain alcohol or a mix). 
Shochu 
Shochu is very similar to soju. It is also
distilled from a starch source and a variety of
raw materials can be used including sweet
potato (a shochu called "imo-jochu") rice,
soba (buckwheat) barley, sugar, chestnuts
and various grains. 
Like soju there is both a single distillation
shochu (Otsu-rui or Honkaku shoku) and a
diluted shochu (Kou-rui shochu). 
Awamori 
Awamori is made from distilling rice. It is
usually aged before selling as kusu awamori
(aged awamori). 
Date: 
31/07/2012 
Change_Date: 
Reason: 
Regardless of whether the translation used on the bottles includes the word
‘wine’, both soju and shochu as well as awamori are concentrated forms of
alcohol produced by the process of distillation and classifiable as spirits in
heading 2208. 
While there are added flavours and sweeteners in some the distilled
products, particularly premium soju, they are minimal and insufficient to
render these products a liqueur. Classification of all these products therefore
falls to 2208.90.90.
