Description: 
Rack cabinets are metal cabinets that
conform to a relevant standard specifying rack
unit dimensions. They are used to house rack
mountable equipment. 
Rack cabinets are used to hold any electrical
or electronic equipment manufactured to meet
the rack unit standards in regard to their
dimensions. This commonly includes
telecommunication, computing, switchgear,
audio, video, entertainment and scientific
equipment. The height of rack mountable
equipment is expressed in rack units (RU or
U). A rack unit is 1.75 inches or 44.45 mm.
Hence equipment may be 9U or 5U high and
so on. Rack cabinets must meet the
specifications for shelf height, hole spacing
and clearances given in the standard to
ensure that they can house any rack
mountable equipment of a compatible U
height. 
This precedent covers both free standing and
wall mounted cabinets. It also covers
cabinets that include other features
compatible with its function of holding
electrical or electronic equipment such as
fans, castor wheels, removable panels, glass
walls or doors, lockable doors or cable entry
points.
This precedent does not cover cabinets with
inbuilt electrical components, other than fans.
In the case of such cabinets, consideration
would need to be given as to whether or not
the particular components changed the
identity of the good.

Reason: 
The cabinets’ main functions are holding other goods of certain sizes and
providing protection in their internal cavity, and hence anything stored
therein, from certain environmental hazards (e.g. knocks, fingers, etc.). The
goods are not identified as safes, strong boxes, or the like. While some
may include locks, they are not specifically built to resist attempts to break
them open by drilling or cutting and do not have the essential character of
safes.
The cabinets are complete goods in their own right. Likewise, the
equipment that may eventually be housed in them is complete equipment
regardless of whether it is placed in a cabinet or not. Hence, the cabinets
are not identified as parts of other goods.
Clearly, the function the cabinets perform is useful in regard to the
equipment they are used with. However, the cabinets are not added or
attached to the equipment as an accessory. The cabinets do not add to the
range of functions of the equipment. Simply because things may commonly
be used together is not in itself determinative of an ‘accessory’ status. A
kitchen cupboard, for example, may be commonly used with dinner sets,
cups, serving ware, bowls, pots etc. but would not be considered an
accessory to any of these objects. The cabinets are not identified as an
accessory to the equipment that may be placed in them. 
The goods are not classified to heading 8473 or any other heading covering
electrical equipment the goods may be used with. The goods are not parts
of such equipment nor are they accessories to such equipment. They do
not add function and are not used solely or principally with any particular
equipment. In particular, note that the goods are not parts or accessories of
goods of 8471 or of 8517. 
Free standing cabinets for placing on the floor fall within the limitations of
Chapter 94 Note 2. Wall mounted cabinets fall within Chapter 94 Note 2(a)
as they are a form of cupboard that is adapted to hold electrical equipment. 
The inclusion of a fan does not alter the character of the goods. Furniture
can include electrical or mechanical components where it does not change
the identity of the goods from furniture. For example, components such as
lights in display cabinets, gas lifts on chairs, electric tilts on recliners,
electronic locks on cupboards, gas nozzles on laboratory benches, or filters
and fans in fume cupboards do not change the identity of the goods to
something other than furniture. In this case a fan keeps anything in the
cabinet cooler, but the good still retains the identity of a cabinet, with the
cabinet structure giving the essential identity to the goods.
Rack cabinets are classified in 9403 by application of Interpretative Rule 1
and Chapter 94 Note 2. Section XV Note 1(f) and (k) are also noted. This
applies to floor standing cabinets, wall mounted cabinets and cabinets
designed to sit on other equipment.
Classification to subheading. 
These types of goods are used offices and in non-office environments, e.g.
server rooms, machine control rooms, recording studios, laboratories,
switchgear installations and other technical environs.
However, if one of their standard uses is in offices, then they are ‘of a kind’.
In that case, classification falls to 9403.10.00 as metal furniture of a kind
used in offices. 
If the goods have features showing they are not of a kind used in an office,
such as construction adapted for outdoor use or an IP rating suitable for use
on a factory floor, then classification falls to 9403.20.00 as other metal
furniture.

Instrument: 
Description: 
The goods, which are the subject of this
precedent, are electric fan/heater/light units.
These units are typically installed in a
bathroom ceiling and are used to extract
moisture (or air) and/or heat and/or light the
room, or any combination of the three
functions. All the elements are housed in one
unit. 
The goods of this precedent do not include
combined ceiling fan/light fittings typically
installed in living spaces or bedrooms. Ceiling
fan/lights consist of a light fitting, often
pendant, housed with the motor and axis of a
ceiling fan. There is no heater. The fan is
designed to circulate air within the room, not
to extract it from the room. Precedent
20350000 provides guidance on the
classification of these goods. 
Date: 
10/10/2014 
Change_Date: 
17/02/2015 
Reason: 
Classification of electric fan/heater/light units falls to subheading 9405.10.00
by Interpretative Rules 3(c) and 6. 
These units are composite goods. The goods can be used as either a fan or
a heater or a light, or a combination. Interpretative Rule 3 must be used to
classify these goods. Possible applicable headings are 8414 (fans), 8516
(heaters) and 9405 (light fittings). No one function is determined to give the
goods essential character, therefore Interpretative Rule 3(b) does not apply. 
Consequently, as the exhaust fan, heating, and lighting functions of the unit
are of equal importance and no essential character can be identified,
classification is determined according to the last occurring heading, 9405
Lamps and light fittings, by Interpretative Rule 3(c). At the subheading level
classification is to 9405.10.00, as electric ceiling lighting fittings, by
Interpretative Rule 6. 
This classification applies whether the goods include light bulbs (LED or
other), wall switches or ducting. 
The conclusions in Mercator Lighting Pty Ltd and Chief Executive Officer of
Customs [2014] AATA 694 (23 September 2014) apply to the classification
of these goods. 
- TCO eligibility 
These goods are not eligible for a Tariff Concession Order. 
These units are not ceiling fans with lights of TCO 1206399. Nor are they
eligible for any TCO for ceiling lights or downlights (e.g. TCO 094160). They
are not eligible for TCOs for heaters such as TCO 0404774 (in addition
these TCOs are classified elsewhere). 
The Interpretative Rules do not apply to the TCO system. The description in
a TCO must describe the complete goods. The following Administrative
Appeals Tribunal cases confirm this principle.

Description: 
The subject of this precedent is ceiling fans
with lights. These units consist of an
integrated ceiling fan and ceiling light. The
fan and light may be used at the same time or
separately. The units have a self-contained
electric motor.
The units are usually imported disassembled
in the retail carton; for example, the main
component including the motor; the blades;
and the light casing may be packed separately
in the carton. 
These goods may also include a remote
control and light/fan switch for wall mounting.
These goods are typically installed in living
spaces, bedrooms, offices and restaurants. 
The classification of these goods was
confirmed by the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal (AAT) in the decisions of Mercator
Lighting Pty Ltd and Chief Executive Officer of
Customs [2014] AATA 694 (23 September
2014). 
This precedent does not cover electric
fan/heater/light units typically installed in
bathroom ceilings. For the classification of
these units refer to precedent 21104400. 
Date: 
17/01/2012 
Change_Date: 
17/02/2015 
Reason: 
Classification of electric ceiling fan/light units falls to subheading 9405.10.00
by Interpretative Rules (IR) 3(c) and 6. 
The units are a composite good consisting of two components fixed
permanently together in a common housing. There is no heading with terms
that cover the entire good.
Electric ceiling fans with a self contained electric motor with an output not
exceeding 125W are classifiable to 8414.51.00.
Electric ceiling lights are classifiable to 9405.10.00. 
Classification falls to IR 3, as supported by the AAT in Mercator Lighting Pty
Ltd at para 39. 
As no heading covers the entire good, both heading 8414 and heading 9405
are considered equally specific under the terms of IR 3(a).
IR 3(b) requires classification to the component that gives the essential
character of the whole good, where this can be determined. In this case,
the fan and light can be used together or separately and serve distinct and
separate functions. The fan circulates air and the light illuminates the
room. The nature of the good is composite. It is a combination fan and light
with two functions. IR 3(b) cannot be applied – see Mercator Lighting Pty
Ltd at para 61. 
As neither IR 3(a) nor IR 3(b) applies, classification is determined by IR 3©,
which directs the classification to the last occurring heading, 9405 – Lamps
and light fittings.
At the subheading level classification of a combined ceiling fan & ceiling
light is to 9405.10.00 as electric ceiling lighting fittings by Interpretative Rule
6. 
This decision was confirmed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in
Mercator Lighting Pty Ltd and Chief Executive Officer of Customs [2014]
AATA 694 (23 September 2014).

to play or practice the sport and the way the goods are put up. The sport
sets covered here are designed purely for 'pretend' play of the sport. For
example, a hollow plastic cricket bat, a soft foam ball and a plastic one-

The attached article gives the essential
character of the goods, with the key ring
being a secondary or minor component. * The
article attached to the key ring is not
principally a novelty, decorative or visually
distinguishing feature/keychain fob, for the key

not have the character of a novelty or decorative key ring and would not be
reasonably expected to be used as a key ring in normal use. Goods so
identifiable are excluded from Section XV by Section XV Note 1(l) and are

Reason: 
Playing cards are pieces of specially prepared heavy paper, thin card, or
thin plastic, figured with distinguishing motifs and used as a set, called a
pack or deck, for playing card games. Playing cards are typically palm-
sized for convenient handling. The front (or "face") of each card carries
markings that distinguish it from the other cards in the deck and determine
its use under the rules of the game being played. The back of each card is
identical for all cards in any particular deck, and usually of a single colour or
formalized design. Because playing cards are both standardized and
commonly available, they are often adapted for other uses, such as magic
tricks, cartomancy, or board games. If imported in a set with other goods
which causes the cards to subsumed in the character of the complete
imported article (e.g. cards imported as part of a board game or in a magic
set) they are excluded from this item. However, playing cards imported
simply as decks will normally be considered as playing cards. Playing cards
include all cards used to play recognised card games. These include the
standard Anglo-American set of 52 cards (four suits with (deuce) to ten,
Jack, Queen, King, and Ace) the 32-card piquet deck (no values 2-6) used
for many European card games including Belote, the Tarot deck used to
play a family of trick-taking card games known as Tarot, Tarock or Tarocco,
the 48-card hanafuda deck from Japan and so on. It also includes playing
cards lexicon, where the cards have letters, and picture cards designed for
playing games for young children such as snap or happy families. Playing
cards (9504.40.00) does not cover trading cards with images (4911.91.00).
Trading cards are cards that are normally collected singularly or in small
sub-sets, either as purchases in their own right or with other goods, in order
to form a complete set. Examples of such collectable cards include cards
showing pictures of sporting figures such as cricketers, baseball players,
footballers etc and giving information on their sporting statistics. These are
not playing cards as that they are not primarily made for the playing of a
card game.

Reason: 
At heading level the goods are clearly classified within 9506. At
subheading level a question arose as to whether the goods are classifiable
within subheading 9506.1 as: "Snow-skis and other snow-ski equipment"; or
within 9506.99 as: "Other". The decision was made that snowboards are
classified to 9506.11.00 on the following basis: 1. Although skis come in a
variety of sizes and shapes the subheading for Skis does not differentiate
between them. The snowboard is considered to be a form of ski for gliding
over the snow, the rider standing on it with feet strapped to it as with a ski.
2. Snowboards are made using the same machines and from the same
constituent materials as other types of skis and are regarded as essentially
synonymous within the wider ski manufacturing community. 3. It is
considered likely that it was the intention of the legislators that all snow ski
equipment should be classified within the classification parameters:
9506.11.00 to 9506.19.00.

Change_Date: 
12/10/2009 
Reason: 
This opinion clarifies why sailboards are classifiable to Chapter 95. Prima
facie headings for classification of sailboards are 8903 (Yachts and other
vessels for pleasure or sports; rowing boats and canoes) and 9506. Sports
vehicles (other than bobsleighs, toboggans and the like) of Section XVII and
sports craft such as canoes and skiffs are excluded from Chapter 95.
However, sailboards are not considered vehicles or craft in the meaning of
Section XVII. Like snow skis and surfboards, sailboards are considered
sporting equipment not transport vehicles or crafts (boats, ships, and
vessels) that can be used in sports (e.g. cars, yachts etc). Thus while
vehicles and craft are classifiable in Section XVII, sailboards, like snow skis
and surfboards, are classifiable in 9506. The Harmonized System
Explanatory Notes clarify by specifically stating that sailboards are excluded
from 8903 and included in 9506.

Reason: 
Only balls classified to subheading 9506.62.00 are potentially eligible to use
this TCO. Heading 9506 covers balls that are for general physical exercise,
sports or outdoor games. It does not cover toy balls of 9503. 
TCO 0104946 covers balls of 9506.62.00 only if they have the following
characteristics. 
� They are identifiable as rugby (rugby league or rugby union), soccer or
volley balls 
� The outer cover of the ball is made of synthetic rubber. 
� They are inflated using an internal bladder. 
� They are suitable for use in general physical exercise, sports or outdoor
games. 
The Macquarie Dictionary defines synthetic rubber as “any of a class of
elastomers made from polymers or copolymers of simple molecules with
properties resembling those of natural rubber”. A characteristic of synthetic
rubber is that it has been irreversibly transformed by vulcanisation and can
elongate and recover. While Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995
does not apply to the interpretation of TCOs, a good definition of synthetic
rubber is provided by Note 4 to Chapter 40. 
Common synthetic rubbers include Acrylic Rubber, Butadiene Rubber,
Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer, Fluoroelastomers, Isoprene Rubber,
Nitrile Rubber, Perfluoroelastomer, Polychloroprene (Neoprene), Polysulfide
Rubber, Silicone Rubber, Styrene Butadiene Rubber and some
polyurethanes. 
This TCO does not cover balls with covers made of materials other than
synthetic rubber, for instance leather, Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) and other
plastics not considered to be synthetic rubber.

Description: 
The purpose of this precedent is to clarify
which goods are eligible for TCO 9200879 as
per the decision in Woolworths Limited and
Chief Executive Officer of Customs [2013]
AATA 730 (11 October 2013). 
This precedent distinguishes between goods
that are similar to skateboards (variously
called caster boards, vigorboards,
waveboards, or by the brand name 'Ripstick')
and skateboards.
Skateboards 
- A skateboard has one board with two small
parallel wheels at each end attached to axles.
It is ridden in a standing or crouching position
and the rider pushes with one foot on the
ground to propel it.
Other boards (examples) 
- A snakeboard has two separate front and
rear portions or platforms connected by a
torsion bar or pivot. It has two small parallel
wheels under each platform. The rider uses a
snake like, duck-footed motion.
- A caster board, or Ripstick, has separate
front and rear portions or platforms connected
by a torsion bar or pivot. It has one wheel
under each platform. The rider uses a twisting
motion to propel it.

Rule 1 and 6. 
TCO eligibility
The description of TCO 9200879 is 'skateboards'. Only true skateboards
are eligible for the TCO.
Ripsticks, vigorboards, waveboards and caster boards etc. are not eligible
for the TCO.
Snakeboards are not eligible for this TCO. TCO 9204091 may apply. 
The Tribunal, in Woolworths Limited, found that, while there are similarities
between skateboards, snakeboards and Ripsticks, there are significant
differences in look, design and operation such that considered objectively,
and in terms of the intention underpinning the TCO, castor boards/Ripsticks
and snakeboards are not properly described as skateboards and are not
eligible for the TCO. 
The recent decision of the Tribunal in Toro Australia Group Sales Pty Ltd
and Chief Executive Officer of Customs (2014) AATA 187 (4 April 2014) is
also relevant. The Tribunal said: 
"… it has been frequently stated in cases dealing with TCOs that the goods
must precisely fit the description set out in the TCO. To say that goods fit
the description precisely does not permit a finding that in addition to the
description set out in the TCO, the goods have other characteristics or
components. To fit the description precisely means that the goods must
have no more or no less of the characteristics set out in the description."

Instrument:
Description: 
Metallic lame (pronounced lar-may) jackets
and vests for use in the sport of fencing. The
lame is a garment worn over the jacket that
covers the valid target area in foil or sabre
(epee does not require a lame since
everything is considered a valid target). Foil
lames need only cover the torso and as such
are sleeveless. The arms are valid target for
sabre so sabre lames have sleeves. Sabre
lames also have a small tab near the collar
where the head cord can connect. Lames are
made of special fabrics that contain metallic
fibres, such as copper, nickel or stainless
steel, or of special conductive fibres. A
"waterproof" liner on the inside (usually nylon
although some early lames actually used
plastic) helps to minimize the risk of electrical
shorts between the lame and a sweat-
saturated jacket. The lame is connected,
usually by a crocodile clip, to the fencer's
body wire. When the button or switch on the
tip of an electric fencing weapon touches the
lame, a contact is made and an indicator light
comes on to indicate this to the referee.

The bats are unfinished, but they have the essential character of a cricket
bat. The machining shape the cleft to the basic bat shape. The pressing of
the cleft compresses the willow fibres to strengthen the blade so that they
can withstand the impact of a cricket ball. The handle is spliced in so to
form a 'bat' being blade and handle. Under IR 2(a) these goods can be
classified as a cricket bat. Prima facie Chapters are Chapters 44 and 95,

However, knives are only covered in Chapter 82 when the blade or working
edge conforms to Chapter 82 Note 1, i.e. the blade is made of one of the
following:
(a) Base metal;
(b) Metal carbides or cermets;
(c) Precious or semi-precious stones (natural, synthetic or reconstructed) on
a support of base metal, metal carbide or cermet; or
(d) Abrasive materials on a support of base metal, provided that the articles
have cutting teeth, flutes, grooves, or the like, of base metal, which retain
their identity and function after the application of the abrasive.

3(a) is not applicable. IR 3(a) states that "when two or more headings each
refer to part only of the materials or substances contained in mixed or
composite goods .., those headings are to be regarded as equally specific in
relation to those goods, even if one of them gives a more complete or
precise description of the goods". IR 3(b) is not considered appropriate. The
board provides the facilities for writing and pinning notices, both of which
merit equal consideration. Neither facility is considered to impart the
essential character. The article is thus classified to heading 9610.00.00 by
IR 3(c).

(b) Delayed fluid absorbency;
(c) Outer cover graphics
Op. 02.01.08
Stated Use: Designed for use by small
children to assist in toilet training
TCO 1134375 is keyed to subheading
9619.00.29. 
This TCO applies to disposable toilet training
pants for infants and not to ordinary
disposable nappies or pants. 
Date: 
28/08/2014 
Change_Date: 
28/08/2014 
Reason: 
The issue of what goods come within the terms of this TCO was examined
in the AAT in Aldi Stores (A Limited Partnership) and Chief Executive Officer
of Customs [2012] AATA 151 (8 March 2012). The Tribunal confirmed the
decision of ACBPS. It was found that the TCO applied to disposable pants
designed to assist toilet training of infants. 
The TCO does not apply to disposable nappies that are of the “lie flat” type
with side fastenings even if they have elasticised waistbands and other
features listed in the TCO.
The TCO specifies that the goods must be pants and that they have stretch
side panels, whether pre-fastened and/or re-fastenable. Ordinary
disposable nappies are not ‘pants’ and do not have stretch side panels. The
AAT found that elasticising at the waist and legs does not qualify as stretch
side panels. 
In addition, the TCO specifies that the disposable pants must have a feature
for “delayed fluid absorbency”. The AAT found “Delayed fluid absorbency is
a feature of pants used to assist small children in toilet training. The Mamia
goods have no such special feature, unlike, for example, Huggies Pull-Ups,
which include a special layer of rayon fibre that remains wet to the touch for
some time after the application of fluid in order to assist toilet training”. 
Disposable toilet training pants are designed to delay fluid being absorbed
so that the child feels wet and learns the signal to go to the toilet. They are
however absorbent so that they do not leak or cause the child to develop a
rash. 
Disposable nappies or pants that are designed to distribute the fluid in a
wider area so that it absorbs fluid more effectively are not eligible for this
TCO. Also a simple failure to absorb 100% of fluid in the least possible time
possible does not mean that the product has a delayed fluid absorbency
feature.

They generally have a non-woven layer next to 
the skin, an absorbent core of cellulose, cotton 
or polymer wadding and an outer waterproof 
layer, with adhesive tape or strips to hold them 
in place.
This precedent only applies to disposable pads 
made of cellulose or textile wadding. It does 
not cover washable pads made solely of textile 
materials, which are classified to heading 9619 
but to subheading 9619.00.90.
Reason: 
The pads are similar articles under heading 9619. 
The goods are excluded from heading 4818 by Chapter 48 Note 2(q):
2.- This Chapter does not cover:
(q) Articles of Chapter 96 (for example, buttons, sanitary towels (pads) and
tampons, napkins (diapers) and napkin liners for babies).
Similarly Note 1(u) to Section XI excludes the goods from heading 5601.
1.- This Section does not cover:
(u) Articles of Chapter 96 (for example, brushes, travel sets for sewing, slide
fasteners, typewriter ribbons, sanitary towels (pads) and tampons, napkins

Description: 
The goods, which are the subject of this 
precedent, are long lasting, reusable women's 
underwear briefs specifically designed to be 
worn for menstrual period and/or light 
incontinence. 
The gusset of the underpants are made of 
technologically developed fabrics in layers. 
The inner surface wicks away moisture away 
from the skin, an inner lining absorbs and 
retains a minimum of 2.5 ml of liquid and the 
outer surface provides waterproof protection. 
The underpants are available in a variety of 
absorption capacities and are intended to be 
rinsed and washed for reuse. Fabrics are 
knitted and can include bamboo, microfiber 
nylon, spandex, cotton and wool materials. 
The underpants can be machine washed. 
The underpants are designed to be worn 
without sanitary pads, incontinence pads or 
tampons, however, depending on the wearer's 
preferences and requirements, they may be 
used in combination with these articles or 
menstrual cups.
This precedent only covers underpants 
specifically designed for incontinence and 
menstrual periods. These products can be 
distinguished by their design features from 
underpants or briefs of heading 6108. Other 
types of underpants or briefs, even if they 
absorb some moisture such as perspiration, 
are classified under heading 6108.

The heading covers napkins (diapers) for adults with incontinence as 
confirmed by the Explanatory Notes (HSENs). Sanitary underpants or briefs 
are similar articles to sanitary towels (pads) and tampons in their purpose 
and to incontinence diapers in form and function. Therefore sanitary 
(menstrual) textile underpants are "similar articles of any material".
The HSENs also state that goods of this heading are generally disposable 
but articles made solely of textiles, and re-useable following laundering, are 
also included. Classification is to subheading 9619.00.30 (Sanitary articles, 
NSA, being women's or girls' briefs or panties or men's or boys' underpants 
or briefs) by application of Interpretative Rules 1 and 6.
