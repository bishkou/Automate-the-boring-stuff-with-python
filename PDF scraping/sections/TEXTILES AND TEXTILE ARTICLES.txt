Description: 
Guidance for the classification of fabric with a
coating, covering or impregnation that causes
a shine. This also relates to 5903 where
plastic coating, covering or impregnation may
also cause a similar effect.
Status: 
F

Change_Date: 
9/10/2009 
Reason: 
Chapter 59 Notes 2 and 5 exclude from headings 5903 and 5907
respectively, "fabrics in which the impregnation, coating or covering cannot
be seen with the naked eye" and direct that 'for the purpose of this
provision, no account should be taken of any resulting change of colour'.
This issue has been examined within the WCO (Classification Opinion
590700/1) and Australia in regard to fabrics with aluminium coatings. With
these fabrics, aluminium wire is melted, transformed into gas, and then
vacuum deposited on one side of the fabric. The metal layer is less than 10
microns thick, does not penetrate the yarns of the fabric and is not uniformly
deposited on the fabric. The vacuum deposition process used produced
such a thin layer of metal that no build up of metal is evident in the
intersections of the yarns nor was the metal itself visible with either the
naked eye or under a microscope. The yarns in the warp and weft were as
distinct as in the non-coated version of the same fabric. What was visible
was a shiny appearance on one side of the fabric. After examination, the
WCO concluded that the shiny surface was produced by metallisation,
which changed the fabric's reflectivity characteristics, and hence was more
than simply a change of colour within the meaning of Chapter 59 Note 5.
Classification of the aluminised fabric is therefore within heading 5907.
Where a fabric appears to have a shine, sheen or lustre, it may or may not
be caused by a coating, covering or impregnation. Processes such as
polishing or calendering can also be used to apply sheen or lustre to fabric.
Likewise some fibres and colours naturally appear more reflective than
others. Where it appears a fabric has a shininess that may indicate coating,
technical evidence should be sought to clarify the nature of the fabric.
Where there is not detectable change to the base fabric, then Note 5
applies and the fabric is excluded from 5907. This substance of this Opinion
also applies in regard to 5903.

Description: 
This precedent gives guidance on what forms
of compression hosiery the Department of
Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) will
accept as medical hosiery that may quote
Item 33 of Schedule 4. 
Graduated compression hosiery is elastic
hosiery designed to compress the leg or legs,
but which exerts the strongest pressure at the
ankle, reducing proportionately up the leg.
The compression strength or pressure of
graduated medical compression stockings is
expressed in mmHg (millimetres of mercury)
of pressure the garment exerts at the
narrowest part of the ankle. The mmHg is
expressed as a range, for example stockings
rated 20-30mmHg will, depending on the
ankle size of the wearer, exert between 20
and 30mmHg pressure at the ankle.
Non-graduated compression hosiery applies
the same compression along its length.
It should be noted that the strength of
graduated compression hosiery from Europe
is normally specified in terms of classes and,
optionally, by mmHg, while hosiery from the
USA is expressed in mmHg. However,
European and American methods of
measuring mmHg vary and hence are often
not directly comparable. 
Provided the hosiery is solely or principally for
medical purposes, DIBP will accept as
medical hosiery graduated compression
hosiery with either a compression level of
European Class 2 or that has a starting point
of its compression range at 20 mmHg or
above.
DIBP will also accept as medical hosiery TED
(thrombo-embolic devices)/anti-embolism
stockings designed for use on non-ambulatory
patients with an inspection panel for checking
blood flow to the foot. 
DIBP will not routinely accept hosiery other
than the above as medical hosiery entitled to
the benefit of Item 33. It is strongly
recommended that if your goods may be
entitled to Item 33, but are not covered by the
descriptions above, that you request a Tariff
Advice from DIBP.
Access to Item 33 is intended for medical
hosiery excluded from Chapter 90 by Note
1(b). Item 33 does not apply to hosiery whose
principal purpose is not medical.
Examples of compression hosiery NOT
entitled to Item 33 include sports performance
enhancement compression wear designed
and sold for enhancing the sporting
performance of healthy athletes, light
compression hosiery for reducing the fatigue
of standing and light compression travel socks
designed principally to improve comfort during
air travel. 
Status: 
F 
Date: 
6/04/2011 
Change_Date: 
Reason: 
Compression hosiery is excluded from Chapter 90 on the basis of Chapter
90 Note 1(b). However if Note 1(b) did not exist, some compression hosiery
designed to support a limb or limbs for medical purposes would be
classifiable in Chapter 90. It is this range of medical hosiery that is eligible
to receive the benefit of Item 33 of Schedule 4.
There are two principal forms of medical hosiery; anti-embolism stockings
(non-graduated) and graduated compression hosiery.
Compression hosiery has a range of uses dependent upon the compression
level and design. Medical uses of graduated compression hosiery include,
but are not limited to, treatment of lymphoedema, varicose ulcers or
thrombophlebitis.
An anti-embolism stocking, also called TED (thrombo-embolic devices)
stocking, is a non-graduated light compression stocking for use for non-
ambulatory patients. It acts by accelerating venous return in patients who
are lying down and hence helps to prevent thrombosis. These have an
inspection opening just above or below the toes in order to check blood flow
without removing the stockings. As the patient is not mobile, higher
compression and graduated pressure is not required in these stockings.
DIBP will accept such hosiery as being entitled to quote Item 33.
Some manufacturers now refer to graduated compression socks or
stockings for mobile patients or for graduated compression travel socks as
anti-embolism stocking/s or TED stocking/s. DIBP assesses this graduated
hosiery as per other graduated compression hosiery in order to determine
eligibility.
Not all compression hosiery is made specifically for medical purposes as
compression hosiery also has a number of general well being or other uses.
For example, light graduated compression can reduce the normal tendency
to mild fluid retention that can occur in the lower legs during either prolonged
standing or sitting. By doing this, it reduces the feelings of fatigue and ache
from long standing, walking or sitting in the workplace or during travel.
Hence there is compression hosiery manufactured to improve the comfort
and feelings of well-being of people such as production line workers, nurses,
long-distance travellers or other people who have to undergo prolonged
periods of sitting, standing or walking. Light to moderate graduated
compression sports garments, including hosiery, are used by some athletes
and sports people to improve sports performance.
These are forms of compression hosiery that, while there may be benefits to
health, are designed primarily for improving comfort or performance and
hence would not be classifiable to Chapter 90 in the absence of Chapter 90
Note 1(b). 
Generally, graduated compression hosiery with a starting compression
range of 20 mmHG and above (or European Class 2 or above) is intended
solely or principally for medical use. Hence DIBP will normally accept such
hosiery as being entitled to quote Item 33.
However, this does not apply if
the specific goods are designed and manufactured for a non-medical
primary purpose. 
For additional information on the use of Item 33 see Schedule 4 Guidelines
on the DIBP website.

The goods of this precedent, are baby wraps

Reason: 
Eligible Tents
Self-erecting tents are tents that will self erect (no human or other external
mechanical action required) when released from being physically held in a
non-erect form.
The frame ribs, being the structural members which support the shape of
the tent, are curved and composed of materials which 'remember' their
arched (rib) shape and will automatically resume that shape unless held to
another.
These tents, when released from the restraint, whether of a bag, straps or
other holding device or of a particular twist & fold configuration or both, pop-
up into a fully erected tent - hence they are also known as pop-up tents.
In order to be eligible to use TCO 9610475, tents must be of the self-
erecting type described above. They must also be made of synthetic fibres.
Non-eligible Tents
Only the types of tent described above are eligible.
Tents that are 'quick erect' or 'quick set' tents which utilise sewn in poles,
hinged poles, central drawstrings to pull up the tent or other methods of
simplifying and speeding up erection of the tent are not eligible tents. These
tents, while they are quicker to put up, still require erection and hence are
not self-erecting.
In the case of the invention of a self-erecting tent which does not have a
flexible rib frame, that is it does not have a frame consisting of flexible and
curved structural members that support the shape of the tent, then this
would not be eligible.
A flexible rib frame tent that does not self-erect is not eligible.
A self-erecting flexible rib frame tent that is not classifiable as a 'tent of
synthetic fibres' in 6306.22.00 is not eligible.

Wraps of knitted cotton fabric are not considered suitable for drying the
baby. Knitted cotton wraps are used for cover and warmth whereas the
function of the towelling article is moisture retention. 
As the goods comply with Section XI Note 7, particularly (b), (d) and/or (f),
classification is to Heading 6307 by IR1 as other made up articles.
Classification to Subheading is 6307.90.29 as knitted articles, IR6.

This precedent includes baby carriers that are
sometimes called wraps. They are made of
textile fabric, often shaped, and usually do not
have padding. They are wrapped around the
baby and the abdomen of the adult. The ends
may simply be tied to secure the baby or they
may have rings or buckles. They usually do
not have shoulder or waist straps as such but
may be shaped to go over the head and
shoulders. 
This precedent applies to these articles if they
are made predominately of knitted fabric.
This precedent does not include wraps that
are squares or rectangles of material in which
a baby is wrapped to be kept warm or
covered. These goods are covered by
precedent 20906200.

Reason: 
The baby wrap carriers are predominantly made of knitted material which
determines the character of the goods. If there is padding or lining of
another material, such as plastic, it does not change the essential character
of the goods. 
These goods are classified to Heading 6307 by IR1 as made up textile
articles in accordance with Section XI Note 7 (b) and (f). Some guidance is
provided by the HSENs to 6307 at (16), which includes “carry cots, portable
cradles and similar carriers for children”. 
The goods are not similar containers to the bags and cases of Heading 4202
and therefore they are not excluded from Heading 63 by Section XI Note 1(l)
as they are not articles of Heading 4202. 
These goods are made of knitted textile fabric and therefore classification
falls to Subheading 6307.90.29, IR6.

for support. Some carriers, usually called
slings, have one shoulder strap that goes
across the body so that the baby is carried in
the nursing position. Some are adjustable to
be used in all three ways. There may also be
padding for the comfort of the baby. These
articles may or may not have plastic linings.
These carriers are soft and can be folded and,
sometimes, are presented with a storage bag.

Reason: 
The above baby carriers are predominantly made of woven material which
determines the character of the goods. If there is padding or lining of
another material, such as plastic, it does not change the essential character
of the goods. 
These goods are classified to Heading 6307 by IR1 as made up textile
articles in accordance with Section XI Note 7 (b) and (f). Some guidance is
provided by the HSENs to 6307 at (16), which includes “carry cots, portable
cradles and similar carriers for children”. 
Baby carriers with shoulder and waist straps are harnesses to strap the
baby to the adult’s body and are not similar containers to the bags and
cases of Heading 4202 and therefore they are not excluded from Heading
63 by Section XI Note 1(l) as they are not articles of Heading 4202.
Classification to subheading will be dependent on whether the material is
woven or knitted etc. Usually these goods are made of woven textiles and
therefore classification falls to Subheading 6307.90.99, IR6.
