Reason: 
Heading 7307 covers fittings of iron or steel mainly used for connecting the
bores of two tubes or pipes together; or for connecting a tube or pipe to
some other apparatus; or for closing the tube or pipe aperture. The heading
does not cover articles used to install or support tubes or pipes (see
HSENs). 
Cast iron is defined by Chapter 73 Note 1: "In this Chapter "cast iron"
applies to products obtained by casting in which the iron predominates by
weight over each of the other elements and which do not comply with the
chemical composition of steel as defined in Note 1(d) to Chapter 72." Note
1(d) states that steel contains by weight 2% or less of carbon. 
The terms of subheading 7307.11.00 are "cast fittings, of non-malleable cast
iron". 
Non-malleable cast iron refers to grey cast iron. It also includes white cast
iron that has not been annealed to form malleable iron. These materials are
considered to be "brittle". 
Grey cast iron is also known as flake graphite cast iron, and less commonly
as lamellar graphite cast iron. It has a micro-structure of graphite flakes. It
has a high carbon content which gives it a dull, grey appearance. 
Grey iron has strong compression properties, i.e. it withstands loads, but it
does not have tensile strength i.e. it will fracture if bent or stretched. Some
of its uses are for cookware, steam pipe fittings, internal combustion engine
cylinder blocks, pump housings, valve bodies, electrical boxes and
decorative castings. It is the most common form of cast iron and is often just
called "cast iron". 
White cast iron is called that because it has a white, crystalline crack
surface if it fractures. Most white cast irons contain <4.3% carbon, with low
silicon contents to inhibit the precipitation of carbon as graphite. It is used
where abrasion resistance is important, such as liners for cement mixers,
ball mills, certain types of drawing dies and extrusion nozzles. 
Subheading 7307.11.00 covers fittings made of grey cast iron or white cast
iron. 
Cast fittings made of other iron, including malleable iron and ductile iron,
and of steel, fall to subheading 7307.19.00 (see precedent 21430200).

Cast iron is defined by Chapter 73 Note 1: "In this Chapter "cast iron"
applies to products obtained by casting in which the iron predominates by
weight over each of the other elements and which do not comply with the
chemical composition of steel as defined in Note 1(d) to Chapter 72." Note
1(d) states that steel contains by weight 2% or less of carbon.
 
The terms of subheading 7307.19.00 are "Other".
 
Cast fittings of grey cast iron and white cast iron are classified to
subheading 7307.11.00. Precedent 21430100 refers. Fittings cast from
other types of iron, including malleable iron and ductile irons, are classified
to subheading 7307.19.00, as well as fittings cast from steel.
 
Malleable cast iron is a specific type of cast iron made by a prolonged
anneal of white cast iron. The annealing, a reheating and cooling process,
changes the chemical composition and structure. There are two groups of
malleable cast iron, which are set apart by factors such as chemical
composition, temperature and time of the annealing process, the annealing
atmosphere and the resulting properties and microstructure. If
decarbonisation is the predominate reaction in the process, the product will
have a light fracture and is called whiteheart malleable. When the fracture
looks dark, it is called blackheart malleable. Pearlitic malleable is a
blackheart variety having a pearlitic matrix.
 
Ductile cast iron is a group or family of materials made by a different
process. Ductile irons have graphite nodules in minute spherical shapes.
The nodules are formed by the addition of an alloy, such as magnesium, to
the molten iron. Ductile irons are also called nodular iron or spheroidal
graphite (SG) iron.
 
Subheading 7307.11.00 covers fittings made of grey cast iron or white cast
iron.
 
Cast fittings made of other iron, including malleable iron and ductile irons,
fall to subheading 7307.19.00. This subheading also includes cast fittings of
steel.
 
Tariff Concession Orders (TCOs)
 
Ductile cast iron fittings are not eligible for TCOs such as 9305440,
9306802, 9607790 and 1044234 for malleable cast iron fittings. As stated
above, malleable cast iron is a specific type of cast iron and is different to
ductile cast irons. Malleable cast iron articles are not eligible for any TCO
that specifies ductile cast iron in the wording.

Steel towers on which wind powered
generators, commonly called wind turbines,
are mounted.
Wind powered generators are wind-driven
electric generators, also called wind power
plants, wind turbine generators, wind driven
generators or wind-turbine powered
generators.
Solid tubular towers for wind powered
generators are usually manufactured in
sections made from flat-rolled steel plates, or
steel conical subsections, welded together.
The sections are then assembled on site.
Towers or sections may be imported with
doors and internal fittings such as ladders and
landings.
This precedent applies to complete or
incomplete, assembled or disassembled, steel
towers. It would also apply to steel lattice
towers.

Reason: 
Heading 7308 specifically includes towers and lattice masts in the examples
of structures and parts of structures of steel in the terms (subheading
7308.20.00 Towers and lattice masts). Interpretative Rule 1 to the Tariff
applies. 
The goods are not identified as parts of either a wind engine (8412.90.10) or
an electric generating set (8503.00.00). The tower is not an integral
component or part of the wind engine or rotor, which is comprised of the
hub, nose cone and blades, or the generating set, which is the rotor plus
generator. Section XV Note 1(f) does not apply. 
Classification of steel towers for wind powered generators is therefore
subheading 7308.20.00. Interpretative Rule 1 and 6.
This classification also applies under Interpretative Rule 2(a) if incomplete
and/or disassembled. 
Tower sections that are not complete or incomplete towers under
Interpretive Rule 2 (a), on importation, are classified to 7308.90.00.

Coach screws 
The Harmonized System Explanatory Notes describe coach screws as large
wood screws with square or hexagonal un-slotted heads, used to fix railway
lines to the sleepers and to assemble rafters and similar heavy woodwork.
Coach screws are generally used for loads greater than a normal wood
screw would be capable of holding, but where it is not possible to use a bolt
as either the end must be sunk in to the timber or there is no access to the
end in order to attach a nut.
The principle difference between coach screws and other wood screws is
the larger size of a coach screw and that they are turned using a wrench or
spanner.
Coach screws are sometimes referred to as screw spikes, lag screws or lag
bolts.

Self-tapping screws.
 
Date: 
9/02/2010 
Change_Date: 
9/02/2010 
Reason: 
Wood screws are metal screws designed to fix something to wood or to
fasten wood to wood.
Wood screws generally have a tapered shank, gimlet point (sharp, pointed
end) and a coarser thread (fewer threads per centimetre) than similar sized
metal screws. They are normally only threaded for approximately 2/3rds of
their shank. This helps avoid bridging (a gap between the two pieces) when
joining two pieces of wood.
Wood screws are often self-tapping: the sharp threads cutting into the wood
around the pilot hole, making the female thread as they enlarge the hole.
They may also be self-drilling so that the point is capable of penetrating the
wood without a pilot hole being drilled first. Regardless of whether they are
self-tapping or self-drilling, screws identifiable as wood screws remain in
7318.12.00.
Some wood screws may be atypical in regard to the above description. For
example, small wood screws may be fully threaded. Where in doubt, a good
guide is whether the screws conform to an Australian or International
Standard for wood screws. If doubt still remains, advice on the specific
goods should be sought from the Department of Immigration and Border
Protection.

Reason: 
Self-tapping screws are screws which are capable of either cutting or
forming a female thread in the hole into which they are screwed. 7318.14.00
covers both forms of self-tapping screws. Self-tapping screws are generally
fully threaded.
7318.14.00 does not cover wood screws even if self-tapping. See 19715400
(coach screws of 7318.11.00 and 19715500 (wood screws of 7318.12.00).
Threaded concrete and masonry anchors that use screws or bolts are not
classified here but in 7318.15.00 even if self-tapping (see 19715600) as they
are identified as screw anchors rather than simply self-tapping screws. It
should be noted that some masonry anchors use other threaded articles
rather than screws or bolts and are not classified in 7318.15.00 but
7318.19.00 - see 19717900.
Self-tapping surgical bone screws (see 19710100) are excluded by Section

Reason: 
These goods share characteristics of both nails and screws, being driven in
like a nail but also being threaded, and in the case of those with a slotted
head, capable of being withdrawn with a screwdriver. These goods are
commonly used in conjunction with sheaths in masonry or drywall anchors.
As the good can not be identified as either a nail or screw in either form or
function, classification falls to 7318 19 00 as an other threaded article.
This is in accordance with COCO 731819/1 issued by the World Customs

Reason: 
A basic anchor bolt is a bolt which has the head embedded in concrete but
with the thread protruding and so available to support a load through which it
passes and to which it is made firm by tightening the nut of the bolt. These
bolts/rods are cast in place when the concrete is poured. Basic anchor bolts
also include headed bolts, bent bar anchors, plate anchors or through bolts.
Bent bar anchors are made as bent rods are usually 'J' or "L" shapes but
include eye bolt and U-bolt shapes.
Alternative anchors exist which can be placed after concrete is set. An
epoxy/chemical anchor bolt is a similar metal bolt or rod which is designed
to be held by epoxy resin in a hole drilled into the concrete or brick by epoxy
resin. Mechanical anchor bolts (sleeve anchors or wedge anchors) are held
in a hole drilled into the concrete by an attachment to the bolt itself which
expands and holds it in when the nut is tightened and are referred to as
expansion bolts. Sleeve anchors work by the expansion of a cylindrical
metal sleeve or shield into the base material as the bolt is tightened. Wedge
anchors work by means of a wedge or wedges that are forced into the base
material when the bolt is tightened.
A newer form of concrete and masonry anchor bolt is the type referred to as
screw-bolts, screw-bolt anchors or screw anchors.
These goods generally cut a thread into the base material but they can be
distinguished from normal self-tapping screws by their design features which
indicate that they are intended for permanent embedment and load carrying.
The specifications will explicitly include their tension and shear load values.
Anchor bolts, expansion bolts, screw-bolts, screw-bolt anchors or screw
anchors are classified to 7318.15.00 under 'other screws and bolts, whether
or not with their nuts or washers'.

an electric food mixer of 8509. The bowls are identified as accessories. As
accessories for goods of 8509 are not specifically mentioned either in the

purpose of these bottles is to hold the beverage in a fashion that facilitates
its consumption while the consumer is in motion.
7323 covers tableware,
kitchenware and other household articles of iron or steel. The Macquarie
Dictionary relevantly defines household as (noun) “the people of a house
collectively; in previous times, a family, including servants, etc.; a domestic
establishment” and (adjective) “of or relating to a household; domestic”. The
types of articles covered by 7323 are those that are used in the normal
course of living (in, or by the members of, the household) as opposed to
goods appropriate to the spheres of industry or commerce.
7323 covers articles for the preparation, serving or consumption of food and
beverages in domestic situations as well as the types of goods typically
used in or around the home. These goods remain here even when they may
be used in other settings. For example buckets, frying pans, letter boxes etc
remain classified although they may be used outside of the home or in
commercial settings. 
While 7310 covers “tanks, casks, drums, cans, boxes and similar

The Harmonised Explanatory Notes (HSENs) provide some examples of
goods that fall to this heading: inspection traps, gratings, drain covers and
similar castings for sewage, water, etc. systems; hydrant pillars and covers;
drinking fountains; pillar-boxes, fire alarm pillars, bollards, etc.; gutters and
gutter spouts; mine tubbing; balls for use in grinding and crushing mills,
metallurgical pots and crucibles not fitted with mechanical or thermal
equipment; counterweights; imitation flowers, foliage, etc. (except articles of
heading 8306); mercury bottles. 
This heading does not cover castings which are products falling in other
headings of the Nomenclature (e.g., recognisable parts of machinery or
mechanical appliances) or unfinished castings which require further working
but have the essential character of such finished products. 
Cast iron is defined by Chapter 73 Note 1: "In this Chapter "cast iron"
applies to products obtained by casting in which the iron predominates by
weight over each of the other elements and which do not comply with the
chemical composition of steel as defined in Note 1(d) to Chapter 72." Note
1(d) states that steel contains by weight 2% or less of carbon. 
The terms of subheading 7325.10.00 are "Of non-malleable cast iron". 
Non-malleable cast iron refers to grey cast iron. It also includes white cast
iron that has not been annealed to form malleable iron. 
Grey cast iron is also known as flake graphite cast iron, and less commonly
as lamellar graphite cast iron. It has a micro-structure of graphite flakes. It
has a high carbon content which gives it a dull, grey appearance. 
Grey iron has strong compression properties, i.e. it withstands loads, but it
does not have tensile strength i.e. it will fracture if bent or stretched. Some
of its uses are for cookware, steam pipe fittings, internal combustion engine
cylinder blocks, pump housings, valve bodies, electrical boxes and
decorative castings. It is the most common form of cast iron and is often just
called "cast iron". 
White cast iron is called that because it has a white, crystalline crack
surface if it fractures. Most white cast irons contain <4.3% carbon, with low
silicon contents to inhibit the precipitation of carbon as graphite. It is used
where abrasion resistance is important, such as liners for cement mixers,
ball mills, certain types of drawing dies and extrusion nozzles. 
Subheading 7325.10.00 covers articles, not classified elsewhere, made of
grey cast iron or white cast iron. 
Cast articles made of other iron, including malleable iron and ductile iron,

Reason: 
The Harmonised System Explanatory Notes (HSENs) provide some
examples of goods that fall to this heading: inspection traps, gratings, drain
covers and similar castings for sewage, water, etc. systems; hydrant pillars
and covers; drinking fountains; pillar-boxes, fire alarm pillars, bollards, etc.;
gutters and gutter spouts; mine tubbing; balls for use in grinding and
crushing mills, metallurgical pots and crucibles not fitted with mechanical or
thermal equipment; counterweights; imitation flowers, foliage, etc. (except
articles of heading 8306); mercury bottles. 
This heading does not cover castings which are products falling in other
headings of the Nomenclature (e.g., recognisable parts of machinery or
mechanical appliances) or unfinished castings which require further working
but have the essential character of such finished products. 
Cast iron is defined by Chapter 73 Note 1: "In this Chapter "cast iron"
applies to products obtained by casting in which the iron predominates by
weight over each of the other elements and which do not comply with the
chemical composition of steel as defined in Note 1(d) to Chapter 72." Note
1(d) states that steel contains by weight 2% or less of carbon. 
The terms of Subheading 7325.99.00 are "Other, other". 
Articles made of grey cast iron and white cast iron are classified to
subheading 7325.10.00. Precedent 21430300 refers. Articles cast from
other types of iron, including malleable iron and ductile irons, are classified
to subheading 7325.91.00 if they are grinding balls and similar articles for
mills; other articles are classified to subheading 7325.99.00. Articles of cast
steel also fall in these two subheadings. 
Malleable cast iron is a specific type of cast iron made by a prolonged
anneal of white cast iron. The annealing, a reheating and cooling process,
changes the chemical composition and structure. There are two groups of
malleable cast iron, which are set apart by factors such as chemical
composition, temperature and time of the annealing process, the annealing
atmosphere and the resulting properties and microstructure. If
decarbonisation is the predominate reaction in the process, the product will
have a light fracture and is called whiteheart malleable. When the fracture
looks dark, it is called blackheart malleable. Pearlitic malleable is a
blackheart variety having a pearlitic matrix. 
Ductile cast iron is a group or family of materials made by a different
process. Ductile irons have graphite nodules in minute spherical shapes.
The nodules are formed by the addition of an alloy, such as magnesium, to
the molten iron. Ductile irons are also called nodular iron or spheroidal
graphite (SG) iron. 
Cast articles, not classified elsewhere, made of iron, including malleable
cast iron and ductile cast irons, fall to subheading 7325.99.00. This
subheading also includes cast articles of steel. 
Tariff Concession Orders (TCOs) 
Ductile cast iron articles are not eligible for any TCO that specifies malleable
cast iron articles. As stated above, malleable cast iron is a specific type of
cast iron and is different to ductile cast irons. Articles of malleable cast iron
are not eligible for any TCO if the wording specifies ductile cast iron.

Shipping containers are classified to heading 8609. The castings are
specially designed for, and used on, shipping containers and can thus be
identified as "parts" for those containers. However there is no provision for
parts to be classified within 8609, either by the terms of the heading or by a
Section or Chapter Note. The castings are, therefore, classified according to
constituent material. As the goods are of cast steel, classification is to
heading 7325.99.00.

Heading: 7610.90.00 
Instrument: 
Description: 
This precedent defines the requirements for a
shipment of goods to be treated as complete,
unassembled aluminium structures. 
This precedent applies only if the finished
good that would result from the assembly of
the goods in the shipment is a complete
aluminium structure that would be classifiable
to 7610.90.00. 
Aluminium structures of 7610 are usually
made up from bars, rods, tubes, angles,
shapes, sections, sheets, plates, wide flats
including so-called universal plates, hoop,
strip, forgings or castings, by riveting, bolting,
welding, bonding together with synthetic
resins or rubber compounds, etc. Once put in
position, structures of 7610 will generally
remain in that position. 
In addition to the types of goods normally
considered "structures", 7610.90.00 also
includes less obvious structures such as pit-
head frames and superstructures; sluice-
gates, piers, jetties and marine moles;
supporting structures and mounting frames for
solar panels or solar dishes; and large-scale
shelving for assembly and permanent
installation in shops, storehouses, etc.
However, it does not include goods that are
simply rails, with or without fastening devices,
used to attach solar panels, satellite dishes,
televisions or the like to an existing structure.
These are simply equipment for fixing
something to an existing structure. They are
neither a part of the existing structure nor a
structure in their own right.
The following goods are examples of goods
not classifiable to 7610, whether or not
assembled. 
- Prefabricated buildings of heading 9406 
- Constructions which are clearly identifiable
as machinery parts 
- Floating structures 
- Constructions that are parts of railway or
tramway, fixtures and fittings or mechanical
signalling equipment or other goods of Section
XVII 
- Movable shelved furniture of 9403 (see
above for non-movable shelving)

Change_Date: 
12/12/2013 
Reason: 
For an importation of goods to be identified as "complete, unassembled
aluminium structures", the following requirements must be met. 
1. There must be the correct number and type of parts needed to make up a
complete structure or a whole number of complete structures. 
The parts shipped must be the exact number and types of parts required for
the specific structure. Evidence of this can take the form of assembly
instructions shipped with the goods or engineering plans for the assembled
goods. 
Goods which are used to replenish stock supplies for use in making up
"made to order" goods or creating 'kits' in Australia are not unassembled
structures. Such aluminium stock may be either parts or
manufacturing/building supplies in the form of profiles, extrusions, flats etc,
but do not have the identity of an unassembled structure. 
2. There must be NO requirement for manufacturing work to be performed in
Australia. 
For imported goods to be considered as complete unassembled aluminium
structures, then only assembly operations are allowable as post-importation
requirements to form complete structures. Assembly operations can include
the use of nails, screws, bolts and other fastening devices, welding, riveting
or bonding together with synthetic resins or rubber compounds. 
If any part of an unassembled structure requires manufacturing work of any
kind, including but not limited to cutting, slitting, trimming, drilling, grinding,
annealing, perforating, punching, straightening, folding, sizing, plating,
coating, cladding or any other working beyond assembly, after arrival in
Australia, then it is not treated as a complete unassembled structure. 
3. The component parts may be packed together or separately packaged for
ease of transportation, but must all be transported as part of the same
shipment. 
The goods may be packed as 'kits' or 'flat packs' which comprise all the
necessary parts to assemble one finished article. This includes all parts and
the necessary fixing or joining items, such as fasteners or screws, needed to
convert the goods in the consignment into fully assembled finished products. 
4. If the goods in the shipment make more than one structure and they are
not packaged into "kits", then it must be able to be shown that they fully
conform to points 1 and 2 and are not simply stock parts. 
That the goods could be assembled into structures is not sufficient evidence
that the goods are unassembled structures. Evidence is required that the
goods have the identity of unassembled structures and are not simply
building materials for structures. Evidence that may support the goods being
unassembled structures includes invoices and shipping documents showing
that they were ordered and shipped as x number of unassembled structures
or evidence that the goods are to fulfil specific domestic orders for
unassembled structures.
If your goods do not meet these requirements, they will not be identified as
complete, unassembled structures. 
If in doubt about any of these matters in relation to your shipment, including
whether you have sufficient evidence of the nature of the shipment or the
classification of goods not meeting these requirements, advice should be
sought from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.

These are circular saw-toothed blades that are combined with an arbor and

or other materials.
Chapter 82 Note 2 gives general authority to classify base metal parts of
articles of Chapter 82 with the articles but also provides certain exceptions
to this rule. One is that parts that are separately specified as such are
classified to the heading in which they are specified. The complete hole-saw
is classified to 8207.90.00 (see 19733700) however the blade alone is a
good included in heading 8202 being a blade for a saw. Hence classification
of the blades, when imported as parts, falls to 8202
Although the blade is circular in shape, it is not a circular saw blade. A
circular saw is a specific entity of commerce being a saw consisting of a
circular plate or disc with a toothed edge, which is rotated at high speed in
machines for sawing logs, cutting timber, etc. A circular saw blade is a blade
for such a machine.

Reason: 
Hole-saws are interchangeable tools for hand tools, whether or not power-
operated, or for machine-tools, hence they meet the terms of 8207. They
are excluded from classification in Section XVII by Section XVII Note 1(k)
which excludes goods of Chapter 82.
They work by cutting a circular hole out of the material using a saw-toothed
circular blade. The complete hole-saw consists of the blade, the arbour,
which attaches to the drill, and a pilot-drill which ensures that the blade cuts
an even circle.
Hole-saws may also come with certain accessories such as quick-release or
quick change mechanisms, cowls (for collecting dusts and debris when
cutting) and ejector springs (for ejecting the core from the tool after cutting.
Where these are imported either attached to the hole-saw or as a set
including the hole-saw and in the appropriate numbers for the hole-saw (for
most accessories 1-to-1) then they may be classified as a hole-saw or a
hole-saw set in this classification
The pilot drill's purpose is to ensure that the hole is sawed true rather than
creating a cylindrical hole by drilling. The blade performs the principal
function of the tool by sawing out a circular piece. Therefore within 8207
classification falls to 8207.90.00, 'other interchangeable tools' as the
function is not drilling.

9/10/2009 
Reason: 
This advice is to assist in clarifying when incomplete or unfinished sign-
plates, name-plates, address-plates and similar plates may be classified to
8310.00.00.
Subheading 8310.00.00 covers informative sign plates, that is plates which
bear words, letters, numbers or designs giving all the essential information
required for a sign-plate, name-plate, advertising plate, address-plate or
other similar plate. Plates which bear this information, and thereby have the
essential character of a sign of 8310, but which require further finishing
processes, such as the drilling of fixing holes or varnishing, remain in
8310.00.00 under Interpretive Rule 2(a).
Base metal plaques or signs which contain the bulk of information essential
to the purpose of the sign at the time of importation but require some details
to be added are also covered by 8310 under Interpretive Rule 2(a). For
example a plate imported showing the essential information about a
machine (make, model, power rating etc) requiring only the insertion of the
individual serial number after import, is classified to 8310.00.00.
Heading 8310 does not cover incomplete plates which, at the time of
importation: * are blank; or * which do not bear letters, numbers or symbols;
or * which bear only particulars incidental to the essential information which
is to be added later. Such plates lack the essential character of a sign
bearing information and are classifiable dependent upon the constituent
material and, where this is applicable to classification, the type and degree
of working. Incidental marking can include borders and commerce marks
relating to the origin and composition of the physical sign. They also
include text or symbols that indicate the placement or type of information
but which do not provide the essential information.
If doubt exists as to whether markings are incidental or essential, it is
recommended that advice be sought from the Department of Immigration
and Border Protection.
