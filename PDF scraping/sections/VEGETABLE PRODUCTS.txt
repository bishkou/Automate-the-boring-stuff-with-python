Instrument: 
Description: 
The goods, which are the subject of this
precedent, are peanuts, or groundnuts, that
have been shelled and have had the skins
removed. These peanuts are often referred to
as blanched peanuts or raw blanched peanuts. 
The classification of these goods was
examined by the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal (AAT) in the decisions of Re:
Gaganis Bros. Imported Food Wholesalers
Pty. Ltd. and Collector of Customs Ref.
S90/68. 
Date: 
17/01/2012 
Change_Date: 
Reason: 
Peanuts, shelled and with skins removed, are classified to subheading
1202.42.00 by Interpretative Rules 1 and 6. 
The classification of the goods, as confirmed by the Tribunal, is based on
the appearance, texture, smell and taste of the imported peanuts, not the
heat treatment they had been subjected to prior to importation.
Peanuts are heated at various times; at harvest time to prevent spoilage by
mould growth; to remove the skins; and to render them unviable for
germination. This heating does not roast or cook the peanuts.
The blanching process is not part of the process of cooking the peanuts.
The purpose of heating in this process is to make the peanuts swell and the
skins loosen so that they can be removed easily by machines; it relates only
to the removal of the skins. Therefore the temperature and time of the
heating process for blanching the peanuts prior to importation is not a
consideration in determining whether the goods are more specifically
described as "ground nuts, not roasted or otherwise cooked" of heading
1202 or "nuts and other edible parts of plants, otherwise prepared or
preserved" of heading 2008.
The Tribunal in Gaganis Bros. did not take the heating method for blanching
as indicative of roasting or cooking; that is, they did not state for example,
that peanuts heated to any specific temperature for any particular length of
time are considered to be roasted or cooked. They looked at the character
of the peanuts themselves as the basis of their determination and compared
the appearance, texture, smell and taste of samples of fresh, blanched and
roasted peanuts.
This approach is supported by the Harmonised System Explanatory Notes
(HSENs). The Tribunal accepted that regard may be had to the HSENs.
The General Notes to Chapter 12 state: 
The seeds and fruits covered by the heading may be whole, broken,
crushed, husked or shelled. They may also have undergone moderate heat
treatment designed mainly to ensure better preservation (e.g., by
inactivating the lipolytic enzymes and eliminating part of the moisture), for
the purpose of de-bittering, for inactivating antinutritional factors or to
facilitate their use. However, such treatment is permitted only if it does not
alter the character of the seeds and fruits as natural products and does not
make them suitable for a specific use rather than for general use.
Unroasted peanuts are suitable for a variety of uses in the food industry
such as snack bars, snack mixes with dried fruit, Asian dishes, as well as
being roasted after importation for eating or making peanut butter. 
The HSENs to heading 1202 state: 
This heading covers ground-nuts (also known as peanuts), whether or not
shelled or broken, which are not roasted or otherwise cooked. The ground­
nuts of this heading may be heat-treated to ensure better preservation (see
General Explanatory Note). Roasted or otherwise cooked ground-nuts fall in
Chapter 20. 
Peanuts are physically changed when roasted or cooked due to a chemical
reaction known as the Maillard reaction. Sugars and proteins react as
moisture decreases to produce compounds that cause typical peanuts
flavours, odours and appearance. The most common compounds are
pyrazines. These compounds are not found, or are found in much lower
levels, in blanched peanuts than roasted peanuts, and can be readily tested
using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GCMS) technology.
A taste difference is very obvious between roasted and blanched peanuts.
Blanched peanuts are bland, beany and often have grassy type flavours.
Roasted peanuts have a typical roast nutty flavour, with elements of
sweet/caramel and a slight level of roast bitterness. The best reference for
taste is peanut butter, as all mainstream commercial peanut butters contain
roasted peanuts.
The Maillard reaction also causes the colour to change from off-white or
cream to light or moderate brown. It is noticeable to the naked eye. The
Section II - VEGETABLE PRODUCTS
Page 8 of 147Industry commonly uses colour meters, validated to USDA colour chips, to
measure this to ensure a standard product. In Gaganis Bros, measurement
with a chromatograph was demonstrated. 
Therefore the classification of this product is determined by the appearance,
texture, smell and taste of the product on importation and/or by testing, such
as Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry and colour meter, by
recognised authorities. This process also renders the peanuts unviable. 
Shelled blanched peanuts are classified to subheading heading 1202.42.00.
