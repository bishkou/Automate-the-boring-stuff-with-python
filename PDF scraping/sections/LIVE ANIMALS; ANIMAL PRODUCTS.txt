Reason: 
This product is classified to subheading 0210.99.00. 
The term ‘salted’ within heading 0210 - Meat and Edible Meat Offal, Salted,
in Brine, Dried or Smoked - covers the addition of salt, as a solid or in
solution (brine), to fresh, chilled or frozen chicken.
Classification of this product falls under 0210.99.00 by Interpretative Rules 1
and 6.
This classification is supported by the WTO Dispute Settlement finding
DS269 of 2006, which found that “there is nothing in the range of meanings
comprising the ordinary meaning of the term 'salted' that indicates that
chicken to which salt has been added is not covered”.
The classification is further supported by WCO COCO 0210.99 of 2008.

Heading: 0402.29.00 
Instrument: 
Description: 
This precedent covers white milk crumb,
being dried sweetened condensed milk used
as a substitute for milk powder in the
manufacture of chocolate confectionery and
other products.
White milk crumb is manufactured by adding
sugar to liquid cow's milk to form sweetened
condensed milk. This is vacuum dried to
become a powder or 'crumb'. The powder is
rolled to standardise the particle size.
Milk crumb usually contains (on a dry weight

Reason: 
This product is classified to subheading 0402.29.00. 
It is identified as milk containing added sugar of heading 0402, not as "other
sugars" of heading 1702. Milk crumb is a dairy product made from cow's
milk. The large quantities of sugar are added to obtain condensation of the
milk and to achieve a desirable caramel like flavour. To be eligible for
subheading 0402.29.00 the white milk crumb must have a fat content in
excess of 1.5 %. White milk crumb with a fat content of less than 1.5% goes
to subheading 0402.10.00.
White milk crumb is classified to 0402.29.00 by Interpretive Rules 1 and 6.
Note that this precedent does not cover chocolate milk crumb or cocoa milk
crumb which is classifiable under heading 1806. 
21065100 
Heading: 0402.99.00 
Instrument: 
Description: 
The good, which is the subject of this
precedent, is sweetened condensed milk.
This product is milk with added sugar that has
been thickened by the evaporation of the
water content. It contains only animal fat and
no vegetable fat. The ratio of concentrated
milk to sugar can vary significantly but is
generally in the range of 40-60% sugar to 60­
40% concentrated milk.

Reason: 
This product is classified to subheading 0402.99.00. 
Sweetened condensed milk is identified as concentrated milk with added
sugar and meets the terms of heading 0402 and is not a good of heading
2106. Heading 1901 is rejected as the product contains only animal fat.
Classification of this product falls under 0402.99.00 by Interpretative Rules 1
and 6.
This precedent is supported by WCO COCO 0402.99/1 of 2004.
Concentrated milk without added sugar is classified to subheading
0402.91.00.

Heading: 0406.10.00 
Status:

Instrument: 
Description: 
The good, subject of this precedent is
mozzarella cheese (other than grated or
powdered mozzarella) whether or not frozen. 
This precedent provides clarification for the
classification of mozzarella cheese and the
changes to the Statistical Codes under
subheadings 0406.10.00, 0406.20.00 and
0406.90.90 made on 1 January 2016. The
Department of Immigration and Border
Protection determined that mozzarella cheese
was classified under subheadings 0406.10.00
or 0406.20.00 and not under subheading
0406.90.90. Therefore on 1 January 2016 the
statistical code for mozzarella cheese was
removed from subheading 0406.90.90 and
codes were inserted under the 0406.10.00
and 0406.20.00.

Heading: 0406.90.10 
Instrument: 
Description: 
The goods, which are the subject of this
precedent, are camembert pieces coated in
bread crumbs (crumbed), or battered, whether
or not precooked.

Reason: 
The relevant subheadings under heading 0406 are: 
0406.10.00 – Fresh (unripened or uncured) cheese, including whey cheese,
and curd 
0406.20.00 – Grated or powdered cheese, of all kinds 
0406.90.90 – Other cheese; Other 
Subheading 0406.10.00 covers "fresh (unripened or uncured) cheese". The
term "fresh" relates not to the length of time the cheese has been held for,
but whether it has been ripened or cured.
The unripened or fresh cheese types of 0406.10.00 are those cheeses
which do not require curing to develop the characteristics of the cheese
type. These cheeses are ready for consumption shortly after manufacture.
They typically have short shelf lives (1-3 weeks) unless preserved (e.g. by
freezing or by vacuum packing). They do not have a rind and are high in
moisture. Unlike ripened cheeses, unripened cheese generally deteriorates
with age.
Ripened or cured cheeses are cheese types that have been ripened (aged
or cured) for a certain time, at particular temperatures and conditions, after
they have been manufactured. During this period the cheese undergoes
biochemical and physical changes, which provide the character of the
cheese in question. They are not ready for consumption until this curing or
ripening has been undertaken.
The Codex Alimentarius (or "Food Code") established by the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health
Organization in 1963, develops harmonised international food standards.
The standard for mozzarella cheese (CODEX STAN 262-2006) clarifies that
mozzarella is an uncured cheese.
As a cheese of the "Fresh (unripened or uncured)" type, mozzarella remains
in this heading even if preserved by freezing. 
Grated or powdered mozzarella is classified under subheading 0406.20.00.

Reason: 
This product is classified to subheading 0406.90.10. 
Camembert pieces, which are crumbed or battered and whether or not
precooked, are considered to have retained the character of cheese of
heading 0406 and of camembert of subheading 0406.90.10. 
Classification of this product falls to subheading 0406.90.10 by Interpretative
Rules 1 and 6. 
Other cheeses of heading 0406, treated in similar ways, would also go to
their respective subheadings in heading 0406.
This precedent is supported by WCO COCO 0406.90/1 of 1994.

Heading: 0511.99.90 
Instrument:
Description: 
The good, which is the subject of this
precedent, is powdered beef plasma. Aseptic
blood is split between the plasma and red cell
fractions. Water is removed from the plasma
fraction yielding powdered plasma. Powdered
plasma is used as a protein concentrate in
food preparations.

Reason: 
This product is classified to subheading 0511.99.00. 
Heading 2106 is rejected as the powdered plasma is not itself a food
preparation. It is excluded from Chapter 30 by Note 1(a). And it is not
identified or classified as albumins of heading 3502. Albumin is a
constituent of plasma. It is classified in heading 0511 as an animal product
not included in any other heading.
Classification of this product is to 0511.99.00 by Interpretive Rules 1 and 6. 
19570400 
Heading: 0511.99.90 
Instrument:
Description: 
The goods, which are the subject of this
precedent, are dog chews, sometimes called
raw hide chews, made from animal skin or
hide (usually bovine) that has not been
tanned. They are given to dogs to clean their
teeth and exercise their jaws. 
The chews are made from a layer of the hide
that is split off the ‘grain’ or upper layer of the
hide during the tanning process. The upper
layer, or ‘grain’, is tanned to make leather.
The excess layer is cut, formed and dried into
various shapes, including a “bone”. A coating
of flavour may be applied. Some chews are
made from multiple layers that have been
compressed under extreme pressure to form
very dense “bones”.

Change_Date: 
28/08/2014 
Reason: 
This product is classified to subheading 0511.99.90. 
Hides that have not been subjected to an irreversible tanning process, which
alters the molecular structure, are not identifiable as leather. The hides, or
skins, are raw when the layer is split or pared off. Chapter 41 Note 1(a)
excludes parings or similar waste of raw hides or skins and directs
classification to heading 0511. 
The tanning industry identifies the goods as "untanned hide pieces". It is
considered the goods are classified to 0511.99.00 as other animal products
not elsewhere specified or included. 
Raw hide dog chews are classified to 0511.99.90 by Interpretive Rules 1
and 6.
