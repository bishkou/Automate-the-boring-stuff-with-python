sufferers of vitiligo. Vitiligo is a condition in
which completely white patches develop in the
skin. The goods are applied externally to
affected bodily areas, and, by chemically

Description: 
Cosmetics put up in sets for use by young
children. The sets the subject of this opinion
contain real cosmetics. They may also contain
other small items such as a mirror or comb

set being a 'cosmetic set'. 
Status: 
F
Date: 
9/10/2009 
Change_Date: 
Reason: 
While the cosmetics may be of low value and are intended for children at
play, this does not automatically make these goods toys of Chapter 95.
Classification of goods sold as toys must take into account the nature of the
goods, any utilitarian value or function, and the impact of terms of headings,
legal Notes and the Interpretive Rules.
Chapter 33 must also be considered. Heading 3304 covers 'beauty or make­
up preparations' within its terms of heading and Chapter 33 Note 3 states
that heading 3304 applies to products - "suitable for use as goods of these
headings and put up in packings of a kind sold by retail for such use".
Section 6, Note 2 states that goods classifiable in heading 3304 - "by reason
of being put up in measured doses or for retail sale are to be classified in
those headings and in no other heading of the Nomenclature". These goods
are real cosmetics so are both 'make-up preparations' and suitable for use
as make-up preparations. They are sold in retail packings for use, by
children, as make-up preparations.

Date:

Change_Date: 
Reason: 
As clarified in the Harmonized System Explanatory Notes (HSEN) these
products are classifiable to heading 3304 - "Beauty or make-up preparations
and preparations for the care of the skin (other than medicaments) ...".
Note 1(d) to Chapter 30 excludes "Preparations of headings 33.03 to 33.07,
even if they have therapeutic or prophylactic properties;". This means that
even if goods have pharmaceutical or disinfectant constituents, they cannot
be classified in Chapter 30 if classifiable in 3304. Wrinkles and beauty (or a
perceived lack of it) are not illnesses and therefore the product is not a
medicament and is included in 3304. This was also the conclusion of the
World Customs Organisation at its 30th Session of the Harmonized System
Committee and this meeting led to the specific inclusion of these goods in
the HSEN to 3304.

Instrument:
Description: 
A cosmetic make up kit comprising assorted
lipsticks, eye shadow of various colours,
blush, applicator brush and applicator foam
stick and presented in a plastic or cardboard
container. This opinion does not cover goods
where the container is of a quality or type that
it is clearly designed to be used long after the
cosmetics are exhausted. This opinion only
covers those kits were the container's
characteristics clearly indicate it is only
intended for use in storing and transporting
the cosmetic goods sold in the container. 
Status: 
F
Date: 
9/10/2009 
Change_Date: 
Reason: 
The goods are identified as a cosmetic kit with the cosmetics of 3304 giving
the essential character. At the subheading level, classification to essential
character is usually not appropriate where there is a balanced range of lip,
eye and skin cosmetics. Classification will normally proceed at the
subheading level on the basis of last occurring being 3304.99.00.

Date:

Change_Date: 
Reason: 
Certain lip ointments are used to treat cold sores, fever blisters etc, and can
be identified as a medicament due to the active ingredients included. Lip
ointments identified as a medicament are classified to heading 3004. Other
lip balms and lip ointments, not containing active ingredients, cannot be
identified as medicaments. These types are used as sun blocks,
moisturisers etc, and are identified as preparations for the care of the skin
and classified to heading 3304. 
Status: 
F
Date: 
9/10/2009 
Change_Date: 
Reason: 
These goods are identified as a shampoo which has therapeutic capability
as opposed to those preparations which are to attend to some scalp
disorder, but do not function as a shampoo. The classifications in
contention appear to be headings 3305 and 3003. Chapter 33 Note 3
confirms the availability of 3305 and Chapter 30 Note 1(d) directs
classification to 3305. Products of 3305 (amongst others) cannot fall to
Chapter 30, even if they have therapeutic or prophylactic properties.
Shampoos, medicated or not, fall to 3305.

Reason: 
Hair dye being colour creme to be used by
professional colourists (hairdresser) and
packaged in tubes, or other packings, of a
size suitable for use by the colourist to colour
a client's hair. 
The user of the dye is the colourist, who uses the dye in providing a hair
colouring service. Federal Court precedent supports the fact that
professionals can be described as ultimate consumers and that sale to a
professional can meet the criteria for being considered a retail sale. The
goods were clearly packaged for use in a manner and in quantities, suitable
without repacking, for sale to the ultimate consumer. Section VI Note 2
requires that goods classifiable to headings 3212 or 3305 (among others) by
reason of being put up for retail sale are to be classified in those headings
and no other heading. As 3212 and 3305 were candidate headings for that
reason, no other headings could be considered. Chapter 33 Note 3 specified
that heading 3305 (among others) applies to goods suitable for use as
goods of that heading and put up in packings of a kind sold by retail for such
use. They are in packings of a kind sold by retail for use as a preparation
for use on the hair. Therefore the Note directs these goods to 3305.

Instrument: 
Description: 
This precedent provides clarification regarding
the classification of chemically impregnated
collars for dogs. The product includes the
chemical propoxur as an active component in
pest control and is used for the control of ticks
and fleas. The product is imported in
packages of a net weight under 300g. 
Status: 
F 
Date: 
13/04/2017 
Change_Date: 
Reason: 
The goods are not classified to heading 3004 as they do not have a
therapeutic or prophylactic effect, within the meaning of that heading. This
is supported by the Harmonized Explanatory Notes to 3004, which exclude
at (e) “Insecticides, disinfectants, etc., of heading 3808, not put up for
internal or external use as medicines”. 
A flea and/or tick collar is identified as being a pesticide made in the form of
a collar. The pesticide is considered to provide the essential character of
the good.
The terms of heading 3808 covers insecticides, rodenticides, fungicides,
herbicides, anti-sprouting products and plant-growth regulators, disinfectants
and similar products, put up in forms or packaging for retail sale or as
preparations or articles (for example, sulphur-treated bands, wicks and
candles, and fly-papers). 
Flea or tick collars are articles and are imported in a form, or packed, for
retail sale. As these goods are classifiable to heading 3808 by reason of
being for retail sale, and are not goods to which Note 1 of Section VI
applies, Note 2 to Section VI directs the goods to be classified in 3808 and
in no other heading of the Nomenclature.
The changes to Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995, taking effect on
1 January 2017, added Subheading Note 2. Where the collars are
impregnated with one or more of the substances listed in Subheading Note
2, the goods are classified to subheading 3808.6. Propoxur is listed in the
Note. 
The ingredients of imported products should be checked for common or
alternative names for all the listed substances. 
At the 8 digit subheading level, goods are classified to subheading
3808.61.90 if the net weight of the contents, that is the goods without the
retail packaging, is 300 g or less. If the net weight is over 300 g but does
not exceed 7.5 kg, classification falls to 3808.62.90. For net weight
exceeding 7.5 kg, subheading 3808.69.90 applies. Classification is by
Interpretative Rule (IR) 1 and 6. 
Where a pesticide collar does not contain a chemical listed in Subheading
Notes 1 or 2, classification will fall to other subheadings of 3808. Note that
ticks are arachnids not insects. Classification will be according to the IRs. 
Classification to heading 3808 is supported by WCO COCO 380891/4 of
2013.
