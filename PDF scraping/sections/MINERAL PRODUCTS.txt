Reason: 
Colemanite being the ore of calcium borate
Terms of heading 2528 include natural borate minerals as extracted,
used to replace boric acid in the manufacture
including concentrates formed in evaporite deposits. Calcium borate is a

Reason: 
Chapter 25 relates to crude minerals, and Note 1 of Chapter 25 specifies
what processes such minerals can undergo whilst still staying within Chapter
25. In the context of mineral processing, levigation refers to processes
clearly understood by industry. It can refer to the classification of a material
in regard to particle size by determining the rate of settling from a
suspension. However, in terms of active processing of minerals, levigation is
the separation of fine powder from coarser material by forming a
suspension of the fine material in a liquid.
