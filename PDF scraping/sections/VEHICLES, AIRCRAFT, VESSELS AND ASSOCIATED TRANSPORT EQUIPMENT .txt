Description: 
'All-Terrain Vehicle' defines a specific type of
vehicle. The phrase is not defined by the
meaning of the individual words. ATVs are, in
reality, often limited in the types of terrain they
can safely traverse, hence the application of
the term ATV is not based on 'all terrain'
capability, but on falling within a class of
vehicles. 
ATVs are motorised vehicles that are
designed for off-road use AND: 
- are designed to travel on low pressure high
flotation tyres, AND
- have a seat designed to be straddled by the
operator, AND
- have handlebars for steering control. 
ATVs are normally intended for use by a
single operator and no passenger, but may
also be designed as 'tandem ATVs', where a
passenger may sit behind the driver (pillion).
ATVs can have three, four or six wheels and
normally have four-wheel drive, but they may
be two-wheel drive or six-wheel drive vehicles. 
ATVs are not registrable for normal road use
in any state or territory of Australia. The
Conditional Registration for ATVs, which
allows for restricted road use under specified
circumstances and which is available to
specified users in various states or territories,
is not considered registration for normal road
use.
"Motorised" includes internal combustion
engines and electric motors. 
This category of vehicles does not include "Ag­
bikes", being motorcycles with special heavy
duty features that make them suitable for farm
use, or Utility Terrain Vehicles (UTVs), being
small four-wheel drive vehicles for off-road
use with side by side seating usually having a
load carrying capacity for goods (see
precedents 20349500 and 20349600). Also,
ATVs that have a cargo tray or compartment
for goods might not be covered by this
precedent. 
This precedent covers ATVs as described
above with petrol engines under 1000cc that
do not have a load carrying capacity. 
Date: 
31/10/2013 
Change_Date: 
18/01/2017 
Reason: 
Heading 8703: - ATVs are covered by this heading if they are principally
designed for the transport of persons i.e. they do not have trays or
compartments for the transport of goods. 
Consideration of classification to subheadings: 
ATVs that are designed for an operator only and no passenger are classified
under subheadings 8703.21.20, 8703.31.20 or 8703.90.20 depending upon
the type of engine and the cylinder capacity as they are not passenger
motor vehicles. 
Chapter 87 Additional Note 5 states that off-road vehicles (defined in
Additional Note 4) are not passenger motor vehicles whether they are
designed to carry a passenger or not. 
Therefore four-wheel drive ATVs that meet the requirements of Chapter 87
Additional Note 4 are classified under subheadings 8703.21.20, 8703.31.20
or 8703.90.20 depending upon the type of engine and the cylinder capacity.
Two-wheel drive and six-wheel drive vehicles are only covered by this
precedent if they are designed solely for use by a driver only.
Two-wheel drive vehicles and six-wheel drive vehicles of 8703 for two or
more people, not being a vehicle falling under any of the exceptions given
within Chapter 87 Additional Note 5, are classified as passenger motor
vehicles and not under these subheadings. 
Classification of ATVs will be dependent upon the type of engine and the
cylinder capacity.
For clarity this precedent has been keyed under the three
expected classifications of: 
- 8703.21.20 for ATVs with petrol engines under 1000cc (20845200);
- 8703.31.20 for ATVs with diesel or semi-diesel engines under 1500cc
(20845400); and
- 8703.90.20 for ATVs with electric motors (20845500).
*Note that classification to 8703.90.20 is applicable only for import
declarations made before 1 January 2017. Changes to Schedule 3 of the
Customs Tariff Act 1995, taking effect on 1 January 2017, created specific
subheadings in heading 8703 for vehicles with electric motors.
Tariff Concession Orders 
In addition, note that when an All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) appears in a Tariff
Concession Order (TCO), it refers to ATVs that: 
a) are motorised off-road vehicles; and 
b) are designed to travel on 4 wheels; and 
c) have a seat designed to be straddled by the operator; and 
d) have handle bars to control steering. 
Only these vehicles will be accepted as eligible for any TCO (see ACN
2013/38). 
Classification of the goods must also be the same as that to which the TCO
is keyed.

Description: 
'All-Terrain Vehicle' defines a specific type of
vehicle. The phrase is not defined by the
meaning of the individual words. ATVs are, in
reality, often limited in the types of terrain they
can safely traverse, hence the application of
the term ATV is not based on 'all terrain'
capability, but on falling within a class of
vehicles. 
ATVs are motorised vehicles that are
designed for off-road use AND: 
- are designed to travel on low pressure high
flotation tyres, AND
- have a seat designed to be straddled by the
operator, AND
- have handlebars for steering control. 
ATVs are normally intended for use by a
single operator and no passenger, but may
also be designed as 'tandem ATVs', where a
passenger may sit behind the driver (pillion).
ATVs can have three, four or six wheels and
normally have four-wheel drive, but they may
be two-wheel drive or six-wheel drive vehicles. 
ATVs are not registrable for normal road use
in any state or territory of Australia. The
Conditional Registration for ATVs, which
allows for restricted road use under specified
circumstances and which is available to
specified users in various states or territories,
is not considered registration for normal road
use.
"Motorised" includes internal combustion
engines and electric motors. 
This category of vehicles does not include "Ag­
bikes", being motorcycles with special heavy
duty features that make them suitable for farm
use, or Utility Terrain Vehicles (UTVs), being
small four-wheel drive vehicles for off-road
use with side by side seating usually having a
load carrying capacity for goods (see
precedents 20349500 and 20349600). Also,
ATVs that have a cargo tray or compartment
for goods might not be covered by this
precedent. 
This precedent covers ATVs as described
above with petrol engines under diesel or
semi- diesel engines under 1500cc that do not
have a load carrying capacity.

Reason: 
Heading 8703: - ATVs are covered by this heading if they are principally
designed for the transport of persons i.e. they do not have trays or
compartments for the transport of goods. 
Consideration of classification to subheadings: 
ATVs that are designed for an operator only and no passenger are classified
under subheadings 8703.21.20, 8703.31.20 or 8703.90.20 depending upon
the type of engine and the cylinder capacity as they are not passenger
motor vehicles. 
Chapter 87 Additional Note 5 states that off-road vehicles (defined in
Additional Note 4) are not passenger motor vehicles whether they are
designed to carry a passenger or not. 
Therefore four-wheel drive ATVs that meet the requirements of Chapter 87
Additional Note 4 are classified under subheadings 8703.21.20, 8703.31.20
or 8703.90.20 depending upon the type of engine and the cylinder capacity.
Two-wheel drive and six-wheel drive vehicles are only covered by this
precedent if they are designed solely for use by a driver only.
Two-wheel drive vehicles and six-wheel drive vehicles of 8703 for two or
more people, not being a vehicle falling under any of the exceptions given
within Chapter 87 Additional Note 5, are classified as passenger motor
vehicles and not under these subheadings. 
Classification of ATVs will be dependent upon the type of engine and the
cylinder capacity.
For clarity this precedent has been keyed under the three
expected classifications of: 
- 8703.21.20 for ATVs with petrol engines under 1000cc;
- 8703.31.20 for ATVs with diesel or semi- diesel engines under 1500cc; and
- 8703.90.20 for ATVs with electric motors. 
*Note that classification to 8703.90.20 is applicable only for import
declarations made before 1 January 2017. Changes to the Tariff, taking
effect on 1 January 2017, created subheadings in heading 8703 for vehicles
with electric motors. 
Tariff Concession Orders 
In addition, note that when an All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) appears in a Tariff
Concession Order (TCO), it refers to ATVs that: 
a) are motorised off-road vehicles; and 
b) are designed to travel on 4 wheels; and 
c) have a seat designed to be straddled by the operator; and 
d) have handle bars to control steering. 
Only these vehicles will be accepted as eligible for any TCO (see CAN
2013/38). 
Classification of the goods must also be the same as that to which the TCO
is keyed.

Description: 
A dumper is a self-propelled wheeled
machine, having an open body, which
transports and dumps or spreads material.
Loading is performed by means external to
the dumper. 
Dumpers of this subheading are designed
specifically for this purpose. They are made to
carry loose, bulk materials and the primary
value of these goods is their ability to dump or
spread this material. 
This precedent clarifies the type of vehicle
classifiable under 8704.10.00 as "Dumpers
designed for off-highway use". 
Date: 
17/01/2012 
Change_Date: 
Reason: 
8704.10.00 covers vehicles that are specifically identifiable as dumpers
designed for off-highway use. 
This classification does not cover other "off-highway" vehicles that have
some dumping functionality but which are actually vehicles for the transport
of goods rather than dedicated dumpers. Off-road vehicles which have
optional or add-on tipping capability, and imported with this tipping option,
are considered a general purpose vehicle with added tipping capability
rather than purpose built dumpers and are not classifiable to this heading. 
Machines which self-load material to be moved, e.g. front end loaders, are
not classifiable here. They will normally fall within Chapter 84 as moving
machinery for earth, mineral or ores. 
The Harmonized System Explanatory Notes (HSEN) provides guidance on
the characteristics of vehicles intended to be classified as dumpers
designed for off-highway use in 8704.10.00. 
* The dumper body is made of very strong steel sheets, or other materials of
similar strength, with its front part extended over the driver's cab to protect
the cab. The whole or part of the floor slopes upwards towards the rear. In
some cases the driver's cab is half-width only. However, certain dumpers
that are specially designed for working in mines or tunnels, for example,
those with a bottom-opening body will have these characteristics with the
exception that they do not have a cab or an extended protective front part of
the body. 
* There is a lack of axle suspension. 
* They have high braking capacity. 
* They have limited speed and a limited area of operation. 
* They use special earth-moving tyres. 
* Because of their sturdy construction the tare weight/payload ratio does not
exceed 1:1.6. 
In addition to the traditional off-highway dumpers described above, this
subheading may also potentially cover other types of dumpers outside of the
above HSEN guidelines, including smaller dumpers of a type generally used
on construction sites for carrying earth, rubble, fresh cement and concrete,
etc. These have a fixed or articulated chassis and two- or four-wheel drive,
the dumper hopper being located above one axle and the driver's seat
above the other. 
To be classifiable in this subheading, the principal purpose of the vehicles
must be dumping and these vehicles must be designed solely or principally
for off-road use. Therefore they will have a sturdy construction, a dumper
hopper designed primarily for loose bulk material and design features which
make the vehicle specifically for off-highway use. Importantly, the features
for tipping will be an integral part of the design. 
The driver's seat in these vehicles is not usually inside a cab. Where the
driver sits or stands on the dumper, rather than in a cab, then the vehicles
are considered to be ride-on dumpers. 
Small pedestrian controlled dumpers may also be classified here where they
meet the characteristics described above.

Reason: 
This type of vehicle has previously been considered by the World Customs
Organization. Although they can carry passengers, their principal function is
seen as carrying cargo or equipment, and hence they are not classifiable to
8703. The provision of a tilt mechanism on the tray enables a dumping
function but the identification of these vehicle remains as a 'UTV' rather than
a dedicated dumper and hence they are not classifiable to 8704.10. While
they are similar to works trucks, they are considered to be general purpose
vehicles for a variety of tasks and terrains and are not classifiable to 8709. 
The term off-road is not defined in the Tariff for 8704. It is taken to mean
vehicles that are designed for use off roads and which are NOT registrable
for normal road use in any state or territory of Australia. The Conditional
Registration for UTVs, which allows for restricted road use under specified
circumstances and which is available to specified users in various states or
territories, is not considered 'registration for normal road use'. 
Classification of these vehicles will depend upon how they are powered. For
clarity this precedent has been keyed under the three expected
classifications of: 
- 8704.21.10 for UTVs with diesel or semi-diesel engines;
- 8704.31.10 for UTVs with petrol engines; and
- 8704.90.10 for UTVs with electric motors. 
Tariff Concession Orders 
In addition, note that when a Utility Task Vehicle or Utility Terrain Vehicle
(UTV) appears in a Tariff Concession Order (TCO), it refers to UTVs that: 
a) are motorised off-road vehicles; and 
b) are designed to travel on 4 or more wheels; and 
c) have side by side seating; and 
d) have a steering wheel. 
Only these vehicles will be accepted as eligible for any TCO (see ACN
2013/38). 
Classification of the goods must also be the same as that to which the TCO
is keyed.

Description: 
The goods, which are the subject of this
precedent, are wheel hub units, also referred
to as wheel hub assemblies; and wheel and
bearing hub units. Wheel hub units are
sealed integrated units that incorporate the
hub, wheel bearing and a mounting flange.
An ABS wheel speed sensor may also be
included in the unit. The hub has wheel studs
which attach to the brake rotor and wheel rim.
On non-drive wheels the hub extends inside
the unit to act as an axle for the bearing to run
on. On drive wheels the units have a splined
hole. The unit encases a double row of
bearings. The opposite end to the hub has a
flange for attaching to the knuckle. 
The classification of these goods was
confirmed by the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal (AAT) in the decisions of Iljin

The goods are parts for motor vehicles of heading 8708.

Section XVII Note 2 (e) excludes some goods of Chapter 84. The relevant
segment of Note 2 states:
 
"Parts” and “parts and accessories” do not apply to the following articles,
whether or not they are identifiable goods of this Section:
 
€ Machines or apparatus of 8401 to 8479, or parts thereof; articles of 8481
or 8482 or, provided they constitute integral parts of engines or motors,
articles of 8483.
 
Heading 8482 does not describe the whole good as they are more than ball
bearings of this heading. See Precedent 21227600 for bearings for wheels
of motor vehicles classified to heading 8482.
 
The goods can be identified as housed bearings of heading 8483 in which
case Note 2€ does not apply as the units are not integral to the engine.
 
The goods are classified to heading 8708 as parts of motor vehicles as it is
the only heading that covers the entire good. Classification falls to
subheading 8708.99.91.

Description: 
This precedent provides clarification regarding
the classification of rotor-powered Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAV), sometimes referred to
as drones. These UAVs achieve flight
through the use of rotors, usually 4
(quadcopter), but also 6 (hexacopter) or 8
(octocopter) rotors, and less than 2000kg in
weight.
This precedent covers UAVs that are imported
without still or video camera functions but may
be capable of being fitted with cameras after
importation. The precedent also covers UAVs
with a video camera where the quality of video
output is suitable only for navigation purposes
when out of sight of the operator. These
UAVs may be capable of transporting and
delivering a small amount of cargo. The
UAVs usually come packaged with a remote
control, batteries and a battery charger.
This precedent does not cover UAVs imported
with inbuilt or attachable video or still cameras
suitable for high quality still or video aerial
photography. 
Status: 
F 
Date: 
31/05/2017 
Change_Date: 
Reason: 
The World Customs Organisation (WCO) has clarified the internationally
accepted classification of UAVs with cameras for high quality still or video
photography to subheading 8525.80 in the Compendium of Classification
Opinions (COCO) - 852580/3. 
In the course of the deliberations, the members of the WCO’s Harmonized
System Committee confirmed that there are two potential classifications of
UAVs supplied with a camera capable of taking high quality still or video
aerial photography; 8802 for the drone itself and 8525 for the camera. 
Therefore, when a UAV is imported without cameras, whether or not it may
be intended to fit cameras after importation, or is imported with a camera
suitable only for navigation purposes, classification is to subheading
8802.11.00 via Interpretative Rule (IR) 1 and IR 6.
It should be noted that rotor powered UAVs imported with inbuilt or
attachable video or still cameras suitable for high quality still or video aerial
photography are classified to 8525.80.10, see precedent 21858300.
