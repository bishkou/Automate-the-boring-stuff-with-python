microelectronics in a housing of copper, fitted
with a switch. They are battery-powered and
may be equipped with a chain fixed to a key
ring and a clasp, of base metal. Laser pointers
produce a red visible coherent light beam in
the wavelength range between 660-680
nanometers (nm). They can project a red
beam and create a brilliant red dot on an
object far away. Laser pointers are commonly

suture material'. Suture needles are instruments and appliances used in
medical, surgical, dental or veterinary sciences and are classified in heading
9018. The subject goods are identified as a set put up for sale for a
particular purpose containing two distinct and separate articles each having
a complementary use one to the other. A suture is the material which
closes the wound whilst a suture needle is the instrument which a surgeon
uses to puncture the skin surrounding a wound and pull the suture material
into place. Each component of the set has an important role to play and
essential character cannot be attributed to either article. As such the goods
are classified in accordance with IR 3(c) to 9018, the last occurring heading
under consideration. At sub-heading level the goods are classified to
9018.90.00 via IR 6, they are more than a needle as described by subÂ­
heading 9018.3 and hence the sub-heading describing Other Instruments
and Appliances applies. Refer also to Precedent no. 19585400 covering
sterile packs of suture material and a sterile suture needle where the suture
is swaged into the hollow end of the needle which has been crimped to
permanently attach the suture to the needle.

Reason: 
Note 4 to Chapter 30 specifies goods which are to be classified within
heading 3006. Paragraph (a) of that Note lists sterile surgical catgut and
similar suture materials. Suture needles are instruments and appliances
used in medical, surgical, dental or veterinary sciences and are classified in
heading 9018. A suture is the material which closes the wound whilst a
suture needle is the instrument which a surgeon uses to puncture the skin
surrounding a wound and pull the suture material into place. Both
components have separate and defined functions, albeit complementary to
one another. Note 4 limits heading 3006 to cover only certain goods. The
phrase 'similar suture material' cannot be construed to mean suture
material attached to a needle. It means material similar to catgut and used
as sutures such as synthetic polymer fibres, metal fibre threads etc. This
being the case, Note 4 does not cover the combined suture and needle
product and classification cannot fall to 3006. The terms of heading 9018,
on the other hand, do describe the goods. In permanently attaching the
suture to the needle it has taken on the character of something new. It is a
sterile, ready for use instrument used by a medical practitioner during
surgery. Classification therefore falls to 9018 via IR 1. At sub-heading level
the goods are classified to 9018.90.00 via IR 6, they are more than a needle

Description: 
Intraocular lenses, being a plastic lens
approximately 5-6 mm in diameter. They are
fully finished as regards to optical properties
and have haptics (locating threads / loops)
inserted into the outer edge. The lenses are
put up in sterilised packs and are ready for
immediate use after washing in suitable sterile
medium. The lenses substitute for the
crystalline human eye lens after a cataract
has been surgically removed. When the
intraocular lens is inserted the haptics are
under pressure in the eye and therefore help
stabilise the lens in the eye's centre.

Nonabsorbable inert sterile porous surgical
mesh knitted from multifilament yarns of
polypropylene polymer. The mesh is intended
to assist in the repair and for reinforcement of
hernia and other fascial defects requiring
support of a nonabsorbable mesh. The
muscle and tendon send out fibrous tissue
which grows around and through the mesh,
incorporating the mesh permanently in the
tissue.
