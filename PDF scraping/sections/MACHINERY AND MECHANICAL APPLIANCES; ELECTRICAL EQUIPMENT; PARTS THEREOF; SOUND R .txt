Instrument:
Description: 
Downhole motor being a turbine rotor and
stator configuration, commonly referred to as
a tubodrill, of a power not exceeding 1,000
kW. The activating mud or water is pumped
at high velocity through the motor. The angle
of the vanes of the rotor and stator cause the
fluid to deflect from the stationary stators on
the turbine body onto the vanes of the rotors.
This turns the rotors which are locked to the
drive shaft, causing the drive shaft to turn and
hence the bit sub and the bit to rotate.

Instrument:
Description: 
Downhole motor being a hydraulically driven
positive displacement motor. These generally
have four components: the by-pass or dump
valve, the motor, the universal joint or
connecting rod section and the bearing and
drive shaft assembly. The motor component
is a spiral or helix shaped steel shaft (the
rotor) rotating within a rubber-sleeved stator.
The stator has one more lobe than the rotor,
hence motors are described as 1/2, 3/4, 5/6 or
9/10 motors depending on the number of
lobes on the rotor & stator. As the fluid is
pumped into the motor, its passage through
the cavities between the rotor and stator
displaces the rotor, forcing it to turn. This
rotational movement is eventually transmitted
to the drill bit.

Heading: 8412.90.10 
Instrument: 
Description: 
Rotor blades for wind powered generators,
commonly called wind turbines.
Wind powered generators are wind-driven
electric generators, also called wind power
plants, wind turbine generators, wind driven
generators or wind-turbine powered
generators. A wind powered generator
operates by directly converting the kinetic
energy of the wind into mechanical energy by
the action of the wind turning the blades or
propeller of an engine or rotor. The rotor is
connected to the main shaft, which spins a
generator to create electricity. 
The wind engine is composed of the hub,
nose cone and blades. A low-speed shaft
transfers the rotational energy into the nacelle,
which contains the generator. The hub may
also contain other equipment such as the
pitch controls. 
Rotor blades for wind powered generators can
be made from fibreglass epoxy resin,
aluminium or composite materials and can
range in size from a diameter of a metre or
less to 40 to 90 metres or more. 
Status: 
F 
Date: 
1/08/2013 
Change_Date: 
Reason: 
A wind engine, or rotor, imported together with a generator is identified and
classified as an electric generating set as the wind engine forms the main
driver (being a rotor or motor) to the generator. Therefore wind powered
generators are classified to heading 8502. The Harmonised System
Explanatory Notes confirms this in the notes to 8502 and 8412. Imported
separately a complete wind engine is classified to subheading 8412.80.00
and the generator to heading 8501. 
The blades are an integral component part of a wind engine, which
comprises the blades, hub and nose cone, of 8412. Goods that are
identifiable as parts of machines or apparatus of Chapter 84 or Chapter 85
are classified in accordance with Section XVI, Note 2. Note 2(a) requires
parts that are goods included in any of the headings of Chapters 84 and 85
to be classified in their respective headings. Note 2(b) requires other parts,
if suitable for use solely or principally with a particular machine or with a
number of machines of the same heading, to be classified with the
machines of that kind. In this case, as no heading in Chapters 84 or 85
describes the blades, they are classified by application of Note 2(b) to
Section XVI, as "parts" suitable for use solely or principally for wind engines. 
Classification of rotor blades for wind powered generators is therefore
subheading 8412.90.10, as parts of engines of subheading 8412.80.00.

Reason: 
In order for a metal plate to be classified in Chapter 84, it must have the
character of either an article of Chapter 84 or a part of such an article. In
regard to pates for heat exchangers that are corrugated plates, pierced with
holes for layering on the frame of the exchanger and cut to shape the
combination of corrugation, perforation and shaping is generally sufficient
working to distinguish them from corrugated flats of Chapter 72 and to
identify the goods as having the character of heat exchanger plates.
Identifiable heat exchanger plates are classified to 8419.90.00 under
Section XVI Note 2(b) as parts. Where the amount of working is insufficient
to allow objective identification as heat exchanger plates, for example
corrugated plate not cut to shape, the goods are normally classifiable as flat-
rolled products of Chapter 72. These flat rolled products can include those
with patterns in relief derived directly from rolling (for example, grooves,
ribs, chequers, tears, buttons, lozenges) and those which have been

Reason: 
Centrifuges remain in 8421 even if specialised for use in laboratories.
These goods do not fit the terms of heading for 9027. While laboratory
centrifuges may be used to prepare materials for testing, they: * do not
perform a physical or chemical analysis; * do not measure or check
viscosity, porosity, expansion, surface tension or the like; and * do not
measure or check quantities of heat, sound or light. The World Customs
Organisation's Harmonized System Explanatory Notes to heading 9027
reflect this in their exclusion of centrifuges, along with various other
apparatus of Section XVI, from classification in 9027 "whether or not, in view
of their low output, small size and general structure, they are obviously
intended for use in laboratories (e.g., for preparing or treating specimens)".
As laboratory centrifuges do not fall to 9027 nor do they fall to any other
heading of Chapter 90, Section XVI Note 1(m) does not apply and they are
not excluded from classification in Chapter 84. Being centrifuges, they meet
the terms of heading of 8421 and classification is to 8421.19.00.

classification of filters for liquid mixtures which
contain water, or for solid/liquid mixtures
where the liquid is water. These have been
variably classified to 8421.21 or 8421.29.
This precedent provides clarification on what
the Department of Immigration and Border
Protection will consider to be water in the
8421.21
- - For filtering or purifying water: 
8421.22
- - For filtering or purifying beverages other than water 
8421.23
- - Oil or petrol-filters for internal combustion engines 
8421.29
- - Other 
context of 'For filtering or purifying water'. 
For the purpose of these sub-headings, the type of filter is defined by the
type of liquid to be filtered.
Water is defined as:
"The liquid which in a more or less impure state constitutes rain, oceans,
lakes, rivers, etc., and which in a pure state is a transparent, odourless,
tasteless liquid, a compound of hydrogen and oxygen, H2O, freezing at 32
degrees F or 0 degrees C, and boiling at 212 degrees F or 100 degrees C."
Source: Macquarie Dictionary 
For a filter to be classified to 8421.21 it must be principally designed to filter
a substance identifiable as 'water' (although presumably impure water).
Filters designed to filter liquids that have lost the identity of being 'water' and
which are mixtures of water and other substances are filters of either
8421.22 or 8421.29, depending on whether the goods are beverages or not.
Water is classified to 2201, 2501 or 2853.
Naturally occurring water (i.e. rain water, ground water, surface water and
sea water) is water. This water will generally have normally existent
impurities, e.g. minerals, dirt, bacteria etc, but is clearly identifiable as
water.
Such water is classified to 2501 if sea water and to 2201 for other
natural waters, whether or not purified. 
Naturally occurring water to which other substances have been added may
still retain the identity of being water. For example 'tap' water that has been
chlorinated or fluoridated is still identifiable as water of 2201 and filters for it
remain identifiable as filters for water.
If however, additions are made to the water that change its identity from
being water of one of these three headings, then filters for the new liquid are
classified elsewhere in 8421.
The following examples are given to clarify this loss of identity. 
Water mixed with sugars and flavours creates a new identity, being a
beverage of 2202 that represents a mixture of water plus other substances,
and filters for the beverage are classifiable under 8421.22.00
Mixed water and ore concentrate creates a new entity being a type of
mineral slurry of Section V and filters for it are classifiable under
8421.29.00
Waste waters, such as industrial process waters, effluent and sewage, are
complex mixtures of solids, chemicals, biological matter and water generally
classifiable under 3825.
Classification of filters for such products falls to
8421.29.00.
It should be noted that it is often possible to reclaim water from such
mixtures. However, when the substance that is passing into the filter is not
classifiable as water, then the filter is not a water filter regardless of what is
produced.

Slurries, suspensions, emulsions and other water inclusive mixtures are
generally not identifiable as water (see precedent 20167800 for guidance on
what is identifiable as water).
For the purpose of these sub-headings, the type of filter is defined by the
type of liquid to be filtered.
Filters for filtering a mixed substance consisting of water and other
substances (other than normal water impurities) are filtering the mixture
rather than water and are classifiable to 8421.29. If the filter recovers water
from an aqueous mixture, this does not change the classification of the
filter. The original mixture is the fluid being filtered, not the resulting water,
hence the filter remains classifiable to 8421.29.

Reason: 
8423.20.00 covers conveyor belt weighers. Belt weighing is the process of
determining the mass-flow rate of bulk material being transported on a belt.
It involves the determination of the weight of material on the belt and the
linear speed of the belt. These two variables are determined separately and
then used together to produce flow rate or total weight.
The weight on the
belt is continuously monitored as it moves over the weigh length (the portion
of the conveyor system used in weighing).
The Dictionary of Weighing Terms (Roland Nater; et al, 2009) defines
conveyor belt weighers as follows. 
“A scale that determines the weight of unpacked, loose, continuously
transported material by weighing the belt loading and measuring the belt
speed while the material is being transported (integrated scale). Conveyor
belt weighers can also be designed as adding scales that weigh the material
in sections.” 
The first sentence of the definition represents the integrating scales and the
second sentence the totaliser scales referred to in the Harmonised System
Explanatory Notes for this subheading.
In addition to conveyor belt weighers, this item also covers equipment
performing the same function for other forms of conveyors such as chain or
bucket conveyors.

Description: 
Reason: 
This precedent clarifies what goods are
considered to be “constant weight scales and
scales for discharging a predetermined weight
of material into a bag or container, including
hopper scales”. 
This subheading covers scales that are designed to determine the
consistency of weight of discrete goods against a target weight and for
discharging a preset weight of material into another container.
Check weighers are covered by this sub-heading. The Dictionary of
Weighing Terms (Roland Nater; et al, 2009) defines checkweigher as
follows. 
“A balance used to check
1. quantities that are separated by mass or volume
2. automatically functioning balances or filling machines for the reweighing
of prepackages.” 
Check weighers are specifically designed to check discrete goods,
particularly pre-packaged goods, to ensure they meet a predetermined
constant weight and will often incorporate mechanisms that relate to the
rejection off the line of goods that are above or below weight. Provided that
the principal function of the composite good remains that of a constant
weight scale, these goods remain here. 
In addition to check weighers, scales specifically for discharging a particular
weight of material into something else are also covered here.
Batch weighers of all types designed to discharge a pre-determined weight
of material into a bag or container are covered here. In this group are
hopper scales, including scales for totalising weights from multiple hoppers.
These remain here when combined with other equipment, for example
weight ticket printing, provided that the essential function remains the
weighing. 
Weighing modules for loss-in-weight (LIW) feeders are also covered here as
they are a form of batch weigher. LIW feeders are a form of gravimetric
feeders where the amount of material is fed through at a constant weight per
unit of time. LIW feeder units discharge the material with a constant weight
per unit of time by weighing the entire feeder and material inside. As the
material discharges, the weighing module monitors and controls the “loss-in­
weight” of the material. The feeder controls regulate the speed of the
feeding device based on the weigh loss to match the desired feed rate or set
point.
Weighing modules for liquid loss-in-weight feeders which feed in
fluids e.g. milk, oils, water etc are also included.
Whether any of the above batch weighers, hopper scales and LIW weighing
modules remain classified here when combined with the hopper, feeder or
other equipment will depend upon the actual goods.
Where the combined
good has the essential function of filling machinery rather than weighing
scales, then classification will generally be to 8422.
(Note that weighing equipment for weigh belt feeders, the other major form
of gravimetric feeder, are covered under 8423.20.00 as conveyor belt
weighers.) 
All of the above goods may incorporate, or work with, conveyors. Where the
conveyors are auxiliary components for moving goods into or out of the
weighing equipment they remain here. Where the weighing takes place on
the conveyor, the goods remain here in 8423.30 provided that the weighing
machinery is either a constant weight scale or, in the case of continuous
weighers, the function is discharging of a predetermined weight of material
into a bag or container.
In distinguishing between conveyor weighers and discharge weighing of
conveyed goods, equipment which weighs the conveyor load for use in
calculating the flow rate is a good of 8423.20.00 not 8423.30.00

types. 
Nozzles which include devices for selecting different spray patterns are
identifiable as “mechanical appliances (whether or not hand-operated) for

Reason: 
8432.80.00 is intended to cover only those flail mulchers designed for use
solely or principally in agricultural, horticultural or forestry applications to
prepare the soil. The major requirements for a mulcher of 8432 are as
follows.
* The focus of the design of a mulcher of 8432 is on the mulched material
and its incorporation into the soil, not the cutting of vegetation or the
appearance of the area post-flailing. These mulchers are often designed to
lay a mat of mulch and will normally be capable of green manure crop kill.
* It is capable of handling the type of materials encountered in one or more
of these applications: that is crop stubble, green manure crops, scrub,
woody weeds and other rough material. In forestry applications this can be
up to saplings and branches.
* It is of a size and power suitable for agricultural, horticultural or forestry
being made for prolonged use in a commercial setting. These mulchers are
intended to attached to tractors and can handle being used as full-time
working implements.
* Flail mulchers of 8432 will be made solely or principally for the agricultural,
horticultural or forestry markets.
Some flail mulchers are suitable for both mowing and mulching grass and
for mulching the remnants of some green crops. Usually these will fall not

The emphasis given in the design of flail mulchers of 8433 is on the
appearance of the area after mowing ("clean finish", "even cut" etc) and the
safety benefits of flail mowing (less likely to throw objects during cutting).
The flails may be shaped (e.g. Y-shaped or a half-Y) to give the mowed
grass a combed or ridged appearance and are usually available as heads
for rough, fine and smooth cuts so that the cutting can be adapted to end
usage for the mowing (e.g. golf course, lawn etc).

powders to large granules and liquids and
operating as follows. A slotted sampling tube
is extended into the product stream and
collects a cross-section of the product stream.
The tube retracts and the sample is delivered
to a collection container. The sampler may be
triggered automatically (e.g. by count or time)
or manually.

Reason: 
Skid steers, without tools and not adapted to a particular purpose, are
identified as goods of heading 8479.
The subject goods do not have the 'essential character' of complete
machines of headings 8425, 8426, 8428, 8430, 8432 or 8433. They are
complete propelling bases which, in use, can be given the character of a
particular machine by the addition of any of the suitable attachments. They
are not a part of any of the machines of these headings. 
The goods are not classifiable to heading 8709 as they do not meet the
terms of the heading. They are not 'of the type used in factories,
warehouses, dock areas or airports for short distance transport of goods'. 
The goods are not tractors of Chapter 87. Note 2 to Chapter 87 states that
‘tractors’ means vehicles constructed essentially for hauling or pushing
another vehicle, appliance or load. See Blackwood Hodge (Australia) Pty Ltd
v the Collector of Customs , New South Wales [1980] FCA 96; (1980) 47
FLR 131 (22 August 1980) No G4 of 1980 for a full examination of the
meaning of ‘tractors’. 
The tools that the importer intends to use with the skid steer are not a
consideration. The Federal Court decision in Blackwood Hodge (Australia)
Pty Ltd stated in relevant part that: 'it is the state or condition of the goods at
the time of importation that is the determining factor. The test is an objective
one. The purpose of the manufacturer or exporter on the one hand or the
importer or the user on the other hand can have no relevance. Otherwise
rates of duty for identical articles would vary depending on what their
proposed use was to be. It is the intrinsic nature of the article itself which
has to be considered.'
As imported, without tools, these propelling bases have multiple uses.
These uses are all equal in that each is a standard use and the machine is
designed for all uses to which it may be put by the addition of an appropriate
skid steer attachment. The second part of Chapter 84, Note 7 states 'a
machine the principal purpose of which is not described in any heading or
for which no one purpose is the principal purpose is, unless the context
otherwise requires, to be classified in 8479.' 
The goods are classified to 8479.89.90 by application of IR 1 and 6 and
Chapter 84, Note 7. 
This classification opinion does not apply to bases designed specifically for
a particular use, or imported as incomplete machines, covered by one of the
headings in the Tariff such as forklifts, cranes, graders etc.

Reason: 
While a wide number of valves may have a role in the safe operation of
equipment, the following definition defines what is accepted as a safety
valve for the purpose of 8481.40:
"a valve which automatically, without the assistance of any energy other
than the fluid consumed, discharges a certified quantity of the fluid so as to
prevent a predetermined safe pressure from being exceeded. It is designed
to re-close and prevent the further flow of fluid after normal pressure
conditions of service have been restored."
The requirements for a valve to be classified to 8481.40 can be broken
down as follow:
- the only purpose of the valve is prevent a predetermined safe pressure
from being exceeded;
- it operates automatically when the internal pressure exceeds the set
pressure of the safety valve with no external or extra energy is required for
the valve to operate apart from that of the fluid discharged;
- the amount of fluid (liquid or gas) discharged is in accordance with its
certification;
- once pressure has reduced to safe levels, the valve automatically closes
(reseats) and seals against further fluid discharge; and
- it remains operational after use, another unsafe increase in pressure will
reopen the valve.

This precedent, and related precedents,
concern wind powered generators (often
called wind turbines or wind power plants,
wind driven generators or wind-turbine
powered generators). Note that the term
‘turbine’ is used in the Tariff for machines of
headings 8410 and 8411. Wind powered
generators are not ‘turbines’ of this type and
therefore the common term ‘wind turbine’ is
not used in this precedent to avoid confusion. 
Wind powered generators generate electricity
by converting the kinetic energy of the wind
into mechanical energy by the action of the
wind turning the blades of a rotor or wind
engine, which in turn spins a generator to
create electricity. Wind powered generators in
wind farms directly transmit electricity to the
power grid. Some wind powered generators
are used to charge batteries or are connected
to off grid establishments. 
Wind powered generators consist of a number
of machines and electrical equipment
mounted in and/or on a structure. The basic
components are a rotor or wind engine and a
generator. The wind engine is the hub and
rotor blades. The rotational energy is
transmitted to the generator housed in the
nacelle. The hub may also contain other
equipment such as the pitch controls. 
The combined wind engine and generator with
associated equipment is usually mounted on a
tall metal pylon or tower. However, small wind
powered generators may be mounted on other
structures such as buildings or on vehicles
such as boats.
Other equipment may also be included in the
nacelle housing or in the tower; such as a
gearbox, electronic control unit, yaw controller
(moves the rotor to align with the direction of
the wind), brakes (stops rotation of the shaft in
case of power overload or system failure),
inverters and/or converters and transformers.

Reason: 
An assembled complete wind powered generator is a composite machine
consisting of two or more machines fitted together to form a whole; wind
engine, generator, gearbox, yaw controls etc. fitted in a steel tower and
nacelle. Classification is to subheading 8502.31: wind powered electric
generating sets by Interpretative Rules (IRs) 1, 6 and Section XVI Note 3.
The generating set (wind engine and generator) performs the principal
function, which is generating electricity.
 
A wind engine, or rotor, imported together with a generator is identified and
classified as an electric generating set of Heading 8502 as the rotor forms
the main driver (being a wind engine or motor) to the generator. The
Harmonised System Explanatory Notes confirms this, stating in the notes to
8502 that “generating sets” applies to the combination of an electric
generator and any prime mover other than an electric motor (e.g. ..wind
engines..)” and, in the notes to 8412, excluding “electric generator units
composed of wind motors mounted integrally with an electric generator
(heading 8502).”
 
A disassembled but complete wind powered generator is classified to
subheading 8502.31 by IR 1, 6 and Section XVI Note 4 as a functional unit
composed of components contributing together to the function of generating
electricity. Section XVI Note 3 does not apply as IR 2(a) expands a heading
to include unassembled articles. It does not expand Notes.
 
Under IR 6, Section Notes 3 or 4, which state respectively “to be classified
as if consisting of that component or as being that machine which performs
the principal function” and “contribute together to a clearly defined function
covered by one of the headings of Chapter 84 or 85, the whole falls to be
classified in the heading appropriate to that function”, applies to the
subheadings.
 
Note that classification to the 8 digit subheadings will depend on the output
of the generating set, NOT the output of the wind powered generator as a
whole. The wind powered generator may contain transformers or inverters
and/or converters.

The 8 digit subheading will therefore be either 8502.31.10 or 8502.31.90
according to the output of the generating set by IR 6 and Section XVI Note 3
or 4.
 
8502.31.10 - - AC generating sets of an output exceeding 500 kVA.
8502.31.90 - - Other
 
The IDM regarding the generating set output, with appropriate conversion to
kVA, must be made available to the Department of Immigration and Border
Protection on demand.
 
Similarly, an importation of all the components for a wind turbine generator,
assembled or disassembled, but minus the tower, will also be classified
8502.31 by IR 1, 6 and Section XVI Note 4.
 
Components imported separately:
 
As wind turbine generators are composite machines or functional units,
components imported separately must be assessed on their individual
merits. Individual components will be classified to appropriate headings
according to the state in which they are imported. Many components will be
classifiable to various headings in the Tariff.
 
Parts for the components, such as the wind engine or generator, will be
classified as parts of the relevant component having regard to Section XVI
Notes 1 and 2.

rotors; 4 rotors being the most common.
These UAVs usually come packaged with a
remote control, batteries and a battery
charger. A headset, or viewing goggles, may
also be included. A smartphone app can
sometimes be used for viewing.
For the purpose of this precedent, the UAV
must be supplied with a camera capable of
taking high quality still or video aerial
photography, whether or not inbuilt. This

Opinions (COCO) - 852580/3. 
The WCO’s Harmonized System Committee decided that there are two
potential classifications of UAVs supplied with a camera capable of taking
high quality still or video aerial photography; 8802 for the drone itself and
8525 for the camera. Neither of these classifications covers the entirety of
the good under Interpretative Rule (IR) 1. Under IR 3(a), if each of the
potential headings covers only part of the goods, none of them is considered
to provide a more specific description. The essential character of the good
is supplied by the camera, the purpose of the machine as a whole being to
enable high resolution still or video aerial photography. Classification under
IR 1, 3(b) and 6 is to subheading 8525.80.10.
It should be noted that rotor powered UAVs supplied without still or video
camera functions, or in cases where the quality of video output is suitable

Reason: 
Radio remote control apparatus for toys or video games are prima facie
classifiable to two headings, as radio remote controls of 8526 and in the
heading for the parent good of Chapter 95.
Note 1(m) to Chapter 95 excludes radio remote control devices from
Chapter 95.
Australian authority (Liebert Corporation Australia Pty Ltd v Collector of
Customs (1993) 23 AAR 287) requires that where goods are excluded from
an area of the Tariff by Note, then any determination that they fall into that
exclusion is a final classification determination in regard to the two potential
headings.
In this case, this means that if the imported goods can be correctly
described as radio remote control apparatus, they can not be classified to
Chapter 95. This holds even if the goods also fall within the terms of a
heading in Chapter 95 or if classification in Chapter 95 appears more
appropriate. 
Although Note 3 to Chapter 95 may also appear to direct the classification of
these goods, it is subject to Note 1 to Chapter 95. Note 3 can not work to
include goods in Chapter 95 that are excluded by the operation of Note 1. 
Radio remote control apparatus are devices that control another device or
system by means of radio signals from a point at a distance from the device
or system. Devices that control toys, e.g. radio remote controls for cars,
planes etc, or radio remote controllers for video game consoles by radio
frequencies are correctly described as radio remote control apparatus.
Hence they fall within the exclusion provided in Note 1(m).
Classification of radio remote controllers for toys or video games is to
8526.92.00.

Vacuum interrupter tube consisting of two
separate contacts and other components
within an evacuated and hermetically sealed
ceramic envelope, also known as the "vacuum
interrupter". The contacts are closed under
normal circuit conditions. In the event of a
fault current the movable contact withdraws
from the fixed contact. Arcing is established
within the vacuum interrupter by withdrawing
the movable contact away from the fixed
contact. This arc burns in the metal vapour
evaporated on local hot spots on the contact
surfaces. At current zero (the half cycle point
where the AC is reversing direction) the
vapour production ceases, the near original
vacuum condition rapidly returning, and the
dielectric strength of the interrupter increases
faster than the recovery voltage, therefore the
circuit is interrupted. These devices are
generally used in high voltage applications,
usually up to 40.5 kV.

12/10/2009 
Change_Date: 
12/10/2009 
Reason: 
Polymeric positive temperature coefficient devices are usually referred to as
resettable fuses, but are actually non-linear thermistors of 8533.2. A fuse
contains a piece of a metal that melts if the current running through it
exceeds a particular level, thereby breaking the circuit. A PTC however
increases its electrical resistance in response to the temperature increase
in an event and then cycles back to a conductive state after the current is
removed and the device cools. The PTC effect limits the flow of the current
to a point where only a trickle of electricity still flows in order to protect
sensitive electronics such as solid-state (silicon-based) integrated circuits.
The thermistor limits the current but does not break the circuit. When the
temperature decreases below its designated trip point, the resistance of
the device reverts back to its original state. These devices have two primary
uses. They can be placed in a series and used as an over-current protector
or they can be used as temperature sensors to protect sensitive electrical
components from damage when the application exceeds a defined
temperature. When they have a power handling capacity handling capacity
exceeding 20 W they are classifiable to 8533.29.00.

Description: 
Reason: 
Programmable controllers are component
devices and 8537.10.10 only covers the
programmable controllers themselves. The
heading does NOT cover machines
incorporating programmable controllers.
A description of PLCs is given in the 'reason
for classification' section of this Precedent to
give guidance on the type of devices the
Department of Immigration and Border
Protection would normally identify as
programmable controllers. 
Programmable controllers will normally comply with the international
standard for programmable controllers, IEC 61131 (or under the old
numbering system - IEC 1131) or an equivalent domestic standard. 
Note: while the tariff refers to these devices as ‘programmable controllers’
(PCs) the older name of ‘programmable logic controllers’, (PLCs) is used in
industry and is more common. The terms ‘programmable controllers’ and
‘programmable logic controllers’ are accepted as interchangeable.
A PLC, like other numerical control apparatus, is microprocessor based and
controls machine-tools, other machinery or industrial/manufacturing
processes.
To do this the PLC receives digital or analogue signals as
input, runs its program to determine the appropriate output response and
sends digital or analogue signals as that output. The program is stored in a
form of non-volatile, writable memory.
PLCs only control. They generally have the facility for extensive input/output
(I/O) arrangements to connect the PLC to sensors and actuators.
They do
NOT perform any actions other than receiving and sending control signals
from the connected devices.
Unlike the average computer, a PLC is normally built to withstand severe
conditions, e.g. dust, moisture, high/low/fluctuating temperatures and
vibration. The inputs and outputs are frequently designed to accept
hardwired connections from the sensors (input) and actuators (output).
Programmed switchboards which allow users to select between a number of
pre-programmed sequences or options, and other numerical control
apparatus that simply allow users to select options or timings are not
PLCs.
Numerical control apparatus that is pre-programmed and which can
not be reprogrammed by the user is not a PLCs. 
The difference between a PLC and these other forms of numerical control
apparatus is that the PLC is freely programmable within the limits of its
functions as a controller of machinery.
IEC 61131-3 defines five programming languages for programmable control
systems: Function Block Diagram (FBD), Ladder Diagram (LD), Structured
Text (ST), Instruction List (IL) and Sequential Function Chart (SFC). Using
the language used by the particular PLC, a user can write and enter a new
program for the PLC to follow.
Unlike a computer (automatic data processing machine) these programs are
constrained by the nature of the PLC to the function of controlling
machinery.
PLCs are components of systems and it is only in this form that they fall to
8537.10.10. Once incorporated into larger systems or machines, the
identity of the PLC is subsumed in the overall identity of the system or
machine. 
However, PLCs imported with integrated or attached human-machine
interface devices, such as keyboards, visual displays etc, whose purpose is
to enable the programming, debugging and/or control of the PLC are not
normally considered to change the identity of the import from PLCs,
provided that they do only perform functions integral to the PLC itself.
Where doubt potentially exists as to whether goods are identifiable as a
PLC, then submitting a Tariff Advice Application may be advisable.

switches, etc for making connections to or in electrical circuits, and fuses,
circuit breakers and other surge suppressors and filters that are apparatus
for protecting electrical circuits.
The goods distribute electricity from one outlet to various devices.
Legislation in each State of Australia requires that electrical multi-outlet
power boards be approved by an Electrical Regulatory Authority before a
manufacturer, importer or retailer is able to supply, or offer to supply, power
boards to the general public. This requires compliance with the relevant
national electrical safety standards.
The standards require that all such power boards incorporate a safety
overload device to help prevent overloading. Therefore all complying
multiple-outlet portable power boards must contain at least two items of
heading 8536 being socket-outlets and a circuit breaker of some sort, and
consequently must be classified to subheading 8537.10.90.

standard light fittings. They pass a current
through a mixture of gases in the tube,
causing the gases to emit UV radiation, which
makes the phosphor coating on the inside of
the tube glow (or fluoresce). 
CFLs generally have inbuilt ballasts so that
they can be used in light fittings that were
made for 
filament light bulbs. There are also 2-pin and
4-pin plug-in compact-fluorescent lamps which
do not have the ballast integrated and hence
