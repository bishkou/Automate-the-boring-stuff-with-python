Reason: 
Edible animal or vegetable oils or fats with additional flavouring or infused
with spices, herbs or other vegetable matter are classified to subheading
1517.90.00. 
Edible oils or fats, which can be classified to Chapter 15 (headings 1501Â­
1516), and to which flavourings or vegetable material, such as herbs or
spices, have been added, are classified as mixtures or preparations of that
oil or fat. Examples of flavourings or vegetable material commonly used to
favour oils or fats include chilli, garlic, rosemary, pepper corns, sage and
truffle. The resulting preparations of oils or fats still retain the character of
the base oils or fat. Classification is to subheading 1517.90.00 using
Interpretive Rules 1 and 6. 
This precedent is supported by the World Customs Organisation's COCO
151790/3 (2008).

made by encapsulating droplets of edible oils
in an edible coating, such as gelatine. The

Reason: 
These goods are preparations of oils, not simply oils. These goods are
ready for marketing to food manufacturers and hence are a completed
preparation.
A "preparation" is "something prepared, manufactured or
compounded".
Whilst not normally used as a food in their own right, these products are
used as an ingredient in foods and are safe to eat. Therefore, these are
edible products of animal oils. 
This classification was affirmed by the AAT in Re Pacific Resources
International Pty Ltd and Chief Executive Officer of Customs [2011] AATA
