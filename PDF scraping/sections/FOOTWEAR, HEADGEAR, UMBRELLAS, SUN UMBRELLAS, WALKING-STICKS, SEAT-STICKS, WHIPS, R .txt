Reason: 
This product is classified to subheading 6402.99.90.
Headings considered were:
- 6401 Waterproof footwear with the outer soles and uppers of rubber or of 
plastics, the uppers of which are neither fixed to the sole nor assembled by 
stitching, riveting, nailing, screwing, plugging or similar processes.
- 6402 Other footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics. 
The HSC decided that the footwear was classified to heading 6402.
The HSC confirmed that the intention of heading 6401 was to cover 
protective waterproof footwear such as wellingtons, gum boots, galoshes and 
overshoes. That is, "waterproof" means that the foot will not get wet, not that 
the footwear itself is waterproofed from damage by water, but does not 
protect the feet. Overshoes, sometimes called "galoshes", are rubber or 
plastic "shoes" that are worn over permeable shoes to protect them and to 
keep the foot dry.
If the footwear has open areas, which leave the foot and/or the ankle 
exposed to water and other liquids, it is not waterproof footwear of heading 
6401. For instance, gardening clogs designed to keep the feet off wet or 
muddy ground but leave the heel exposed and/or have holes in the upper, 
are not deemed to be waterproof footwear.
The HSC classified the plastic moulded sandals and shoes, all of which 
exposed the heel or ankle or had holes in the uppers, to subheading 
6402.99.90 by application of Interpretative Rules 1 and 6..e

Reason: 
Heading 6406 in Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 includes goods
described as: 
6406 PARTS OF FOOTWEAR (INCLUDING UPPERS WHETHER OR NOT
ATTACHED TO SOLES OTHER THAN OUTER SOLES);... 
6406.10 - Uppers and parts thereof, other than stiffeners: 
6406.10.10
--- Parts, of metal
6406.10.90 --- Other 
Uppers, with or without attached soles other than outer soles, are classified
to subheading 6406.10.90.
Schedule 2 of Customs Regulation 185 of the Customs Regulations 1926
(the Excluded Goods Schedule) lists 'Footwear uppers' in Column 3 as
goods for which a Tariff Concession Order can be made.
TCO 0501207 was made with the wording 'Uppers, footwear'. Classification
of goods for this TCO must be to 6406.10.90. This classification includes
uppers with or without attached soles other than outer soles.
In relation to the manufacture of footwear, the term 'upper' generally relates
to an assembly of the parts that cover the toes, the top of the foot, the sides
of the foot and the back of the heel. However, some footwear manufacturing
methods include the insole prior to the lasting of the shoe, and therefore the
insole is a part of the upper. For example, the insole of a moccasin is
created out of a continuation of the upper. In the Strobel or Sewn Sock
method of footwear manufacture, the insole is sown into the upper. In both
cases, the uppers will include an insole.
This precedent clarifies that the term 'Uppers, footwear' in TCO 0501207
refers to the formed part of a shoe, boot, slipper or other item of footwear,
whether or not attached to soles, but does not include footwear parts with
the outer sole attached or parts that make contact with the ground.
