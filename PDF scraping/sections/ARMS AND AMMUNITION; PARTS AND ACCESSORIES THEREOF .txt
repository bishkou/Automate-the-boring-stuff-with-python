Heading: 9304.00.00 
Instrument:
Description: 
Hand held electric-shock devices designed to
administer an electric shock for the purpose of
subduing a person. These devices are often
referred to as "Tasers" (trade name) stun
guns or stun batons. Often used by law
enforcement personnel to subdue potentially
dangerous or belligerent assailants, a "Taser"
is an electroshock weapon that uses Electro-
Muscular Disruption (EMD) technology to
cause neuromuscular incapacitation or NMI
and strong muscle contractions through the
involuntary stimulation of both the sensory
nerves and the motor nerves. This precedent
covers all similar electric-shock weapons
which have the same essential character and
use as the above. There are currently two
modes of operation of these devices. The first
mode works by firing projectiles (normally
small dart-like electrodes) which stay
connected to the main unit by conductive wire.
The second mode of operation requires direct
contact between the device's electrodes and
the body. It administers an electric shock by
generating an electric arc between the two
electrodes.

Reason: 
The subject goods are identified as a weapon for incapacitating humans,
generally in a law enforcement situation. As such they are considered to be
correctly classified within heading 9304.00.00 as 'Other Arms' vide IR 1.
The terms of this heading are considered broad enough to encompass such
weapons in both modes of operation, as evidenced by the examples in the
HSEN to 9304 including gas guns, truncheons, aerosol spray cans and
knuckledusters.

Reason: 
Identified as "other arms" of heading 9304 rather than "toys" of 9503. As
replica guns capable of firing a projectile have the potential to cause injury,
they are covered by the term "arms". Because of the risk of injury, they are
inappropriate for use as playthings by children and thus are not identified as
toys. (AAT decision Re: Mans Nominees Pty. Ltd. and Collector of Customs
Ref. V89/375 refers).

Description: 
Paintballs, designed for use in skirmish type
war games. They consist of a non-toxic water

plastic ball. They are fired from a gas powered
rifle.

Reason: 
Paintball is a game in which players use compressed-gas-powered guns
(paintball markers) to shoot each other with small balls of encapsulated
colour (usually gelatine based). When these paintballs break, they leave a
brightly-coloured mark signifying that the player is eliminated from the
game. Paintball guns are identified as goods of 9304 00 00 (see
19586400). As paintball markers are projectiles fired from a gas-operated
firearm, they can be classified to Chapter 93. They therefore can not be
classified to Chapter 95 as Chapter 95 Note 1(s) excludes articles of
Chapter 93. Within Chapter 93, the goods are capsules that are classified
as other projectiles in 9306 90 00.
